# Manual EOD Settlement Implementation Summary

## Testing Results

All tests completed successfully in isolated environment:

### ✅ Test 1: Automatic vs Manual Logic
- Manual process replicates automatic behavior exactly
- Same validation logic (4pm check, file completeness)
- Same operations executed (roll_4pm_prices, perform_eod_settlement)
- Prevents duplicate runs

### ✅ Test 2: Database Operations
- Manual trigger executes exact same database operations
- Proper state transitions (sodTom → sodTod)
- All symbols processed in same order
- Duplicate prevention works correctly

### ✅ Test 3: Code Change Safety
- Commenting out `self._start_4pm_monitor()` is safe
- File processing continues to work normally
- roll_2pm_prices still called on every file
- Manual trigger remains available

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Code Change
In `lib/trading/pnl_fifo_lifo/close_price_watcher.py` line 105:
```python
# Change from:
self._start_4pm_monitor()

# To:
# self._start_4pm_monitor()  # Disabled - use manual trigger (run_manual_eod_settlement.bat)
```

### Step 2: Deploy Manual Scripts
1. `scripts/manual_eod_settlement.py` - The manual trigger logic
2. `run_manual_eod_settlement.bat` - Operator-friendly batch file

### Step 3: Update Documentation
Update `scripts/run_close_price_watcher.py` header comments to reflect manual process.

## What Changes for Operators

**Before**: 4pm roll happened automatically at 4:00pm or 4:30pm
**After**: Operator runs `run_manual_eod_settlement.bat` when ready

The batch file will:
1. Show current file status
2. Verify time conditions
3. Require confirmation
4. Execute exact same operations

## Safety Features

1. **Time checks**: Still enforces 4pm minimum time
2. **File checks**: Shows which files received
3. **Duplicate prevention**: Cannot run twice for same day
4. **Confirmation required**: Must type "yes" to proceed
5. **Force option**: Available for special cases

## Rollback Plan

To re-enable automatic process:
1. Uncomment line 105 in close_price_watcher.py
2. Restart the Close Price Watcher service

No other changes needed - all code remains intact.
