# Working Directory Fix Applied

## Problem
- Tests were running from `tests/diagnostics/` directory
- RosettaStone couldn't find `data/reference/symbol_translation/ExpirationCalendar_CLEANED.csv`
- File exists but relative path was wrong

## Solution Applied
Modified `run_optimization_tests.py`:
- Added directory change to project root at start of main()
- Uses `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent` to find project root
- Changes directory before running any tests

## Changes Made
1. **run_optimization_tests.py** (line 34-38):
   ```python
   # Change to project root directory to ensure all relative paths work
   import os
   project_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent
   os.chdir(project_root)
   print(f"Changed working directory to: {os.getcwd()}")
   ```

2. **run_optimization_tests.bat** (line 12-13):
   ```batch
   echo Running optimization tests from project root...
   echo Current directory: %CD%
   ```

## Result
- All relative file paths will now resolve correctly
- RosettaStone will find its CSV file
- Database files will be found
- Tests should run successfully
