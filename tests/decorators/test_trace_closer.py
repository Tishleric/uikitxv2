"""
Unit tests for the TraceCloser decorator.

These tests validate the TraceCloser decorator's functionality for context management, 
UUID generation, and interaction with other trace decorators.

# mock_psutil_process and mock_psutil_cpu fixtures are available

# --- Test Functions ---

# test_trace_closer_generates_uuid_if_none remains the same
# test_trace_closer_uses_existing_uuid remains the same
# test_trace_closer_exception_logging remains the same
# test_trace_closer_stacking remains the same

# --- REMOVED test_trace_closer_handles_context_reset_failure ---
# This test is removed because reliably mocking ContextVar.reset failure
# with unittest.mock is problematic.

# test_trace_closer_existing_uuid_no_data remains the same

# (Include the unchanged test functions here if providing the full file)
