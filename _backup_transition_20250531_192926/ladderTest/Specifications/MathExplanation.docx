Projected PnL Calculation Formula for Scenario Ladder

The Projected PnL (Profit and Loss) at each price level in the scenario ladder is calculated cumulatively, starting from a spot price with an initial PnL of 0 and a position of 0. The calculation is performed in two passes: one for price levels at and below the spot price, and another for price levels above the spot price. Here's the mathematical representation:

Key Variables:
- P_spot: Spot price (decimal format) where the initial position and PnL are set to 0.
- P_i: Price at level i (decimal format), where i is the index of the price level.
- Pos_(i-1): Position (number of contracts) before executing orders at level i.
- PnL_i: Projected PnL at level i, in dollars.
- Delta P_i = P_i - P_(i-1): Price difference between level i and the previous level i-1.
- BP_change = 0.0625: Price change per basis point (BP), equivalent to 2 display ticks or 1/16 in decimal price.
- BP_i = Delta P_i / BP_change: Number of basis points moved between level i-1 and level i.
- Dollars per BP = 62.5: Dollar value per basis point movement per contract ($62.5/BP/contract).

PnL Formula:
The PnL at each level i is calculated as:
PnL_i = PnL_(i-1) + (Pos_(i-1) * BP_i * 62.5)

Where:
- PnL_(i-1) is the PnL from the previous level (initially 0 at the spot price level).
- Pos_(i-1) is the accumulated position before any orders at level i are executed.
- BP_i = (P_i - P_(i-1)) / 0.0625 represents the basis points moved from the previous price to the current price.
- The term Pos_(i-1) * BP_i * 62.5 calculates the incremental PnL for moving from price P_(i-1) to P_i with the position held at level i-1.

Position Update:
After calculating PnL_i, the position is updated based on orders at level i:
- If there is a buy order at level i, Pos_i = Pos_(i-1) + Q_i, where Q_i is the quantity bought.
- If there is a sell order at level i, Pos_i = Pos_(i-1) - Q_i, where Q_i is the quantity sold.
- This updated position Pos_i is used for calculating the PnL at the next level i+1.

Notes:
- Initialization: At the spot price level (or the closest level used as the pivot), PnL_0 = 0 and Pos_0 = 0.
- Direction of Calculation: For levels below the spot price, the calculation proceeds from higher to lower prices (decreasing P_i). For levels above the spot price, it proceeds from lower to higher prices (increasing P_i), with a separate initialization at the spot price.
- Rounding: The final PnL_i value is rounded to 2 decimal places for display.
- Applicability: This explanation and formula are tailored specifically for the 10-year note (e.g., ZN). For other instruments like the 5-year note (ZF) or others, the constants (such as BP_change and Dollars per BP) and calculation details may differ slightly due to varying tick sizes or contract specifications.
