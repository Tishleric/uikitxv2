# Live Environment vs Test Simulation Comparison

## Test Environment (What We Did)
1. **Direct Function Calls**
   - Called Greek calculation functions directly
   - Manually executed position weighting logic
   - Bypassed all service architecture

2. **No Redis Pipeline**
   - Skipped Redis pub/sub completely
   - No message serialization/deserialization
   - No async messaging delays

3. **No PositionsAggregator Service**
   - Simulated the logic but not the service
   - No background threads or continuous processing
   - No symbol translation through RosettaStone

4. **No Spot Risk Calculator**
   - Used BondFutureOption directly
   - Skipped the spot_risk.db intermediate storage
   - No batch processing of multiple options

## Live Environment (Production Pipeline)
```
1. Spot Risk Calculator Service
   ├── Reads market data
   ├── Calculates Greeks via BondFutureOption
   ├── Stores in spot_risk.db
   └── Publishes to Redis channel

2. Redis Message Bus
   ├── Channel: "spot_risk:results_channel"
   ├── Message format: JSON array of GreekResult objects
   └── Async pub/sub pattern

3. PositionsAggregator Service
   ├── Subscribes to Redis channels
   ├── Translates symbols via RosettaStone
   ├── Multiplies by position quantities
   └── Writes to positions table

4. FRG Monitor UI
   └── Queries positions table every 2 seconds
```

## Critical Gaps in Our Test:

### 1. Symbol Translation
- **Live**: "TJWQ25C1 112.5" might need translation
- **Test**: We used the exact symbol from database

### 2. Data Flow Format
- **Live**: Greeks flow as JSON through Redis
- **Test**: Direct Python object passing

### 3. Service State
- **Live**: Services must be running
- **Test**: Everything executed in single process

### 4. Timing/Concurrency
- **Live**: Async processing, potential race conditions
- **Test**: Synchronous, deterministic execution

## Why Greeks Are NULL in Production:

Despite our test showing correct calculations, Greeks are NULL because:

1. **PositionsAggregator Not Running**
   ```bash
   # This service must be running:
   python -m lib.trading.pnl_fifo_lifo.positions_aggregator
   ```

2. **No Spot Risk Calculations**
   ```bash
   # No Greek calculations have been performed
   spot_risk.db has 0 rows
   ```

3. **Redis Pipeline Inactive**
   - No messages being published
   - No subscribers listening

## The 10,000x Discrepancy Mystery:

Our test shows the calculations are correct (2,835,174 for 120 contracts).
If the user sees ~283.5, possible explanations:

1. **Different Data Source**: User might be seeing Greeks from:
   - A different calculation system
   - Cached/stale values
   - A different tab (Greek Analysis tab?)

2. **Unit Confusion**: 
   - Position might be 0.12 instead of 120
   - Greeks might be divided by 10,000 somewhere else

3. **Display Formatting**:
   - UI might be dividing by 1,000 for display
   - Additional scaling for "per $100" notional

## Next Steps:

1. **Start the Live Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   # Start Redis
   redis-server
   
   # Start PositionsAggregator
   python -m lib.trading.pnl_fifo_lifo.positions_aggregator
   
   # Run spot risk calculations
   python -m lib.trading.actant.spot_risk.run_calculations
   ```

2. **Monitor Redis Messages**:
   ```python
   # Subscribe to see what's actually flowing
   import redis
   r = redis.Redis()
   p = r.pubsub()
   p.subscribe('spot_risk:results_channel')
   for message in p.listen():
       print(message)
   ```

3. **Check Symbol Translation**:
   - Verify RosettaStone mappings
   - Ensure symbols match between systems
