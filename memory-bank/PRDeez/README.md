# PRDeez Directory

This directory is intended to contain:

- Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
- User stories
- Acceptance tests
- Feature specifications

Currently, the project is using the memory-bank files for high-level documentation and requirements, with detailed implementation handled in code comments and test suites.

As the project expands, formal PRDs and user stories will be added to this directory.
