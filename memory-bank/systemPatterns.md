# System Architecture & Design Patterns

## Architectural Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture
- **BaseComponent ABC**: All UI components inherit from this abstract base class
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Complex UI elements composed from simpler ones
- **Uniform Interface**: All components have consistent initialization and render methods

### Decorator Pattern
- **Function Decorators**: @TraceTime, @TraceCloser, @TraceCpu, @TraceMemory
- **Context Sharing**: Context variables for passing data between decorator layers
- **Layered Decoration**: Decorators designed to be stackable in a specific order

### Observer Pattern (Logging)
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent format for log events
- **Multiple Handlers**: Console and SQLite handlers for different logging needs
- **Centralized Configuration**: Logging system configured in one place

## Design Patterns

### Factory Method
- Component creation follows factory method pattern for consistent initialization

### Adapter Pattern
- Components act as adapters around Dash/Plotly components, providing a simplified interface

### Facade Pattern
- High-level components like Grid provide a facade over complex layout requirements

### Strategy Pattern
- Logging strategies can be swapped based on configuration

## Code Organization

### Package Structure
- **core/**: Abstract base classes and protocols
- **components/**: Concrete UI component implementations
- **decorators/**: Function decoration for tracing and logging
- **lumberjack/**: Logging configuration and handlers
- **utils/**: Shared utilities (color palette, etc.)

### Dependency Flow
```
components/ ──► core/
    ▲
    │
utils/ ───────┘
    ▲
    │
decorators/ ──► lumberjack/
```

## Communication Patterns

### Event-Based
- UI components communicate through Dash callbacks (not explicitly in this package)

### Tracing Chain
- Decorators form a chain of responsibility for function execution tracing
- Recommended order: @TraceCloser(outermost) → @TraceMemory → @TraceCpu → @TraceTime(innermost)

## Error Handling

### Decorator Robustness
- All decorators must handle exceptions gracefully
- Original function errors are preserved and re-raised
- Tracing continues even when errors occur

### Validation
- Input validation in component constructors
- Type hints enforced through mypy
