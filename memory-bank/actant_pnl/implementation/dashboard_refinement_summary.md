# Dashboard Refinement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the refinements made to the PnL Dashboard to improve accuracy, usability, and alignment with the Excel model.

## Critical Data Fixes

### 1. Shock to Basis Points Conversion (Critical Fix)
- **Issue**: Incorrect multiplier (4) was being used to convert shocks to basis points
- **Fix**: Updated to correct multiplier (16) matching Excel model
- **Files Updated**:
  - `pnl_calculations.py` line 223: Changed from `shocks * 4` to `shocks * 16`
  - `csv_parser.py` line 68: Updated default shock_multiplier from 4.0 to 16.0
- **Impact**: All PnL and price calculations now use correct basis point values

### 2. Time to Expiry Label
- **Issue**: Time was labeled as "years" but value was actually in days
- **Fix**: Changed label from "years" to "days" in data summary
- **File**: `pnl_dashboard.py` line 385
- **Note**: No mathematical conversion needed - value was already correct

## UI/UX Improvements

### 3. Added Price Comparison Graphs
- **Enhancement**: Now showing both price and PnL graphs
- **Implementation**:
  - Split `create_pnl_graph()` into two graphs
  - Added `_create_price_graph()` for price comparison
  - Added `_create_pnl_only_graph()` for PnL comparison
- **Display**: Price graph on top, PnL graph below

### 4. Improved Table Organization
- **Enhancement**: Split into separate price and PnL tables with better column organization
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `_create_price_table()` with columns: Actant | TS from ATM | TS from Neighbor | **Shift (bp)** | Differences
  - Created `_create_pnl_only_table()` with columns: Actant PnL | TS from ATM | TS from Neighbor | **Shift (bp)** | Errors
  - Shift (bp) column highlighted in middle for easy reference
- **Benefit**: Clearer data presentation with logical grouping

### 5. Axis Label Corrections
- **Change**: Updated x-axis label from "Shock (basis points)" to "Shift in bp"
- **Reason**: More accurate terminology matching Excel model
- **Applied to**: Both price and PnL graphs

### 6. ComboBox for Expiration Selection
- **Change**: Replaced ListBox with Dropdown (dcc.Dropdown)
- **Files**: `pnl_dashboard.py`
  - Removed ListBox import
  - Replaced "expiration-listbox" with "expiration-dropdown"
- **Benefit**: More familiar UI pattern, better styling control

## Graph Improvements

### 7. Descriptive Titles
- **Price Graph**: "{Option Type} Option Price Comparison"
- **PnL Graph**: "{Option Type} Option PnL Comparison"
- **Table Headers**: Similar descriptive titles for clarity

### 8. Consistent Naming
- Changed "TS from ATM (0)" to "TS from ATM" for consistency
- Changed "TS Neighbor" to "TS from Neighbor" for clarity

## Technical Improvements

### 9. Path Resolution (Previous Fix)
- Dashboard now works regardless of where it's run from
- Uses `SCRIPT_DIR` to find data files and modules
- See `dashboard_path_fix.md` for details

## Testing Status
- Dashboard starts successfully with all changes
- Data loads correctly from CSV file
- Both graphs and tables display properly
- Dropdown expiration selector works

## Known Issues to Address
- Anomalous put option data point mentioned by user (needs investigation)
- May need to review put option calculations specifically

## Next Steps
1. Investigate put option calculation anomaly
2. Validate all calculations against Excel model
3. Consider adding data export functionality
4. Add tooltips/help text for better user understanding
