# Spot Risk Pipeline Analysis
Date: 2025-07-27

## Summary

The spot risk processing pipeline is functioning correctly with the following performance metrics:
- **Bloomberg Translation**: 98.5% success rate ✅
- **vtexp Matching**: 40% success rate ⚠️ (limited by data availability)
- **Greek Calculations**: 94.6% success rate ✅
- **RosettaStone Translator**: Working correctly ✅

## Key Findings

### 1. ActantTime Format
- **Status**: ✅ Already Correct
- The ActantTime format in `ExpirationCalendar_CLEANED.csv` is already using the correct `ZN.N.G` pattern
- All 324 entries follow this consistent format
- vtexp CSV files also use the matching `XCME.ZN.N.G.{date}` format

### 2. Symbol Translation
- **Status**: ✅ Excellent
- RosettaStone successfully replaced all legacy translators
- 98.5% translation success rate (130/132 symbols)
- Failed translations are for futures (XCME.ZN.SEP25, XCME.ZN) which are expected

### 3. vtexp Matching Issues
- **Status**: ⚠️ Data Coverage Issue
- Only 40% of options have vtexp values matched
- Root cause: vtexp CSV files have limited date coverage
- Missing data for expiry dates: 23JUL25, 24JUL25, AUG25
- The matching logic works correctly when data is available

### 4. Greek Calculations
- **Status**: ✅ Good
- 94.6% success rate (123/130 positions)
- Failures are due to market prices below minimum safeguard thresholds
- This is expected behavior for far out-of-the-money options

## Pipeline Flow Verification

1. **File Monitoring**: `SpotRiskFileHandler` watches `data/input/actant_spot_risk/`
2. **Parsing**: `parse_spot_risk_csv` processes files with:
   - Column normalization
   - Bloomberg translation using RosettaStone
   - vtexp loading for options
3. **Greek Calculation**: `SpotRiskGreekCalculator` computes Greeks
4. **Storage**: 
   - Processed CSVs saved to `data/output/spot_risk/processed/`
   - Data stored in `spot_risk.db`
   - Market prices updated in `market_prices.db`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **vtexp Data Coverage**: 
   - Investigate why vtexp CSV files have limited date coverage
   - Ensure vtexp generation process covers all active option expiries
   - Consider implementing fallback calculation if pre-calculated values unavailable

### Future Enhancements
1. **Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - Add real-time pipeline health metrics
   - Track translation, vtexp matching, and Greek calculation rates
   - Alert on degraded performance

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add configuration for acceptable match rate thresholds
   - Option to fail pipeline if critical metrics drop below thresholds
   - Better error reporting for missing vtexp data

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Pre-flight check for vtexp data completeness
   - Validation that all expected expiries have vtexp values
   - Warning system for incomplete data coverage

## Test Scripts Created

1. `scripts/test_pipeline_comprehensive.py` - Full end-to-end pipeline test
2. `scripts/monitor_spot_risk_pipeline.py` - Pipeline health monitoring
3. `scripts/simple_vtexp_test.py` - vtexp debugging utilities
4. `scripts/fix_actanttime_format.py` - ActantTime format verification (no changes needed)

## Conclusion

The spot risk pipeline is fundamentally sound and working as designed. The primary issue is incomplete vtexp data coverage rather than any coding or architectural problems. With complete vtexp data, the pipeline would achieve >90% match rates across all metrics.
