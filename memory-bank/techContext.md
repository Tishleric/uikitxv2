# Technical Context

## Tech Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **Python**: >= 3.12
- **Dash**: v3.0.4 - For web-based UI components
- **Dash Bootstrap Components**: v1.6.0 - For styled Dash components
- **Dash Table**: v5.0.0 - For data table component
- **Plotly**: v6.0.1 - For visualization components

### Development Tools
- **Ruff**: Linting and code quality
- **MyPy**: Static type checking (--strict mode)
- **Pytest**: Testing framework
- **Pytest-cov**: Test coverage tracking

### UI Component Architecture
The UI component library is built as a wrapper around Dash/Plotly components, providing:
- Consistent styling and theming
- Simplified API
- Type-safe interfaces
- Well-documented interfaces

### Tracing & Logging System
- Context variable-based tracing
- Function execution logging
- Performance metrics (CPU, memory)
- SQLite-based persistence for logs
- Structured logging format

## Constraints & Guardrails
- No direct imports from SQLAlchemy or sqlite3 in decorators
- All components inherit from BaseComponent
- Strict typing throughout the codebase
- No cyclic imports
- All public interfaces must be documented

## Development Environment
- Python 3.12+ virtual environment
- IDE with mypy and ruff integration recommended
- Pre-commit hooks for quality checking

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for all components and utilities
- Integration tests for decorators
- Mock objects for external dependencies
- Comprehensive coverage of error cases
