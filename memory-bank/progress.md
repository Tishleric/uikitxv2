# Project Progress

## 2023-11-14 Project Restructuring

### Completed
- Moved components, core, and utils from src/uikitxv2/ to src/
- Updated all import statements to use the new structure
- Updated Memory Bank documentation with new file paths

### Remaining Structure
- Components directory with all UI component wrappers
- Core directory with BaseComponent class
- Utils directory with color palette
- Component tests
- Memory Bank documentation

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more UI components as needed
- Improve test coverage for components
- Enhance styling options for components

## 2023-11-14 Codebase Pruning

### Completed
- Removed all decorator-related code from core and decorators directories
- Removed all database-related code and files
- Removed examples directory and its contents
- Updated pyproject.toml to remove unnecessary dependencies
- Updated Memory Bank documentation (code-index.md and io-schema.md)
- Removed all empty directories (decorators, db, and their subdirectories)
- Cleaned up all cache directories (.mypy_cache, .pytest_cache, .ruff_cache, and all __pycache__ directories)
- Removed empty files (__about__.py)

### Remaining Structure
- Components directory with all UI component wrappers
- Core directory with BaseComponent class
- Utils directory with color palette
- Component tests
- Memory Bank documentation

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more UI components as needed
- Improve test coverage for components
- Enhance styling options for components

## 2025-05-01 Decorator Test Suite Implementation

### Completed
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for all decorator modules
- Created test files:
  - `tests/decorators/conftest.py` with shared fixtures for decorator testing
  - `tests/decorators/test_logger_decorator.py` for function logging decorator tests
  - `tests/decorators/test_trace_cpu.py` for CPU usage tracking decorator tests
  - `tests/decorators/test_trace_memory.py` for memory usage tracking decorator tests
  - `tests/decorators/test_trace_closer.py` for resource tracing decorator tests
- Added tests for basic functionality, error handling, and edge cases
- Included stress tests to ensure robustness with multiple/nested calls
- Added proper mocking for external dependencies (psutil, logging)
- Updated `code-index.md` with new test files

### Next Steps
- Run the tests to validate implementation
- Add integration tests to validate decorators working together
- Consider adding test coverage measurement
- Explore adding performance benchmarks for decorators
