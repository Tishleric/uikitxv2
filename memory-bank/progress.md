#### Task 2: Parent-Child Tracking ✅ COMPLETED  
- Added thread_id, call_depth, start_ts_us fields
- Database-level relationship inference
- SQL view for parent-child queries
- Zero runtime overhead approach

#### Task 3: Legacy Decorator Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Implemented "Track Everything by Default" approach:**
- Made @monitor capture EVERYTHING by default:
  - args=True (all function arguments)
  - result=True (return values)
  - cpu_usage=True (CPU delta)
  - memory_usage=True (memory delta)
  - locals=False (still opt-in due to verbosity)
- Created decorator migration guide for legacy decorators
- All legacy decorators now route through @monitor()
- Zero breaking changes - old code continues working
- New code gets full observability automatically

#### Task 4: Retention Management ✅ COMPLETED (June 17, 2025)
**Implemented simple, robust 6-hour rolling window retention:**

**Design Decision**: After analyzing multiple approaches (partitioning, incremental vacuum, etc.), chose the simplest solution:
- Just DELETE records older than 6 hours
- Let SQLite handle free space naturally
- No VACUUM operations (avoid spikes in 24/7 markets)
- Accept 15% overhead for maximum robustness

**Implementation**:
- **RetentionManager**: Simple DELETE operations with WAL mode
- **RetentionController**: Background thread every 60 seconds
- **Integration**: Added to start_observability_writer() with retention_enabled flag
- **Testing**: 25+ unit tests, integration tests, demo script

**Key Achievement**: Steady state reached after 6 hours - database size stabilizes as deletions equal insertions. No manual intervention needed.

#### Task 5: Create Dash UI (Next)
- Model: ObservabilityRepository, MetricsAggregator
- View: 7-column trace table, dependency graph
- Controller: Query optimization, real-time updates

#### Development Philosophy Applied
- "Track Everything" - 100% observability by default ✅
- No shortcuts - investigated root causes, implemented proper fixes ✅
- Simple solutions thoroughly tested > complex solutions with edge cases ✅

### Future Enhancement: Distributed Tracing (Phase 9+) 🔮 FUTURE - CRITICAL
- **Current Behavior**: Each @monitor decorated function creates independent traces
  - Nested/child function calls get separate trace_ids
  - No parent-child relationships tracked
  - Call hierarchy must be inferred from timestamps
  
- **Critical Design Requirements** (When We Return to This):
  - **Parent-Child Tracking**: Carefully devise system to maintain call hierarchy
    - Use Python's `contextvars` to create thread-local trace context
    - Parent trace_id propagated to ALL child calls within execution context
    - Support for async/await and thread boundaries
    - Handle generator functions that may execute across multiple parent contexts
  - **Trace Context Propagation**:
    - Root spans: Functions called from non-monitored code get new trace_id
    - Child spans: Functions called from monitored code inherit parent trace_id
    - Cross-service: Support trace headers for distributed systems
  - **Data Model Enhancement**:
    - Add `parent_trace_id` and `root_trace_id` columns
    - Add `span_id` for unique identification within a trace
    - Add `depth` field for nesting level
    - Consider adding `follows_from` for async relationships
  
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create `TraceContext` class using contextvars.ContextVar
  - Modify @monitor to check/create/propagate context
  - Database schema migration with new relationship fields
  - Query optimization for trace tree reconstruction
  - UI components for call tree visualization
  
- **Why This Matters**:
  - Debug complex flows across multiple services
  - Identify performance bottlenecks in call chains
  - Understand true cost of operations (inclusive time)
  - Track async operations and their relationships

### SumoMachine Pricing Monkey Automation (February 6, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Created Standalone Automation Script**: Built `SumoMachine/PmToExcel.py` for automated data extraction

- **Data Processing Pipeline**:
  - Parse 5-column clipboard data (Notes, Trade Amount, Price, DV01, DV01 Gamma)
  - Clean numeric values by removing commas
  - Convert prices from XXX-YYY format (e.g., "123-456" → 123 + 456/32)
  - Scale DV01 and DV01 Gamma values by dividing by 1000
  - Preserve decimal precision with 3 decimal places formatting
- **Excel Export**: Write processed data to `C:\Users\g.shah\Documents\Pm2Excel\ActantBackend.xlsx` at cell A2 using openpyxl

- Risk now represents DV01 risk (dollar value of 1 basis point) rather than raw position
- Applied to both calculation passes (above and below spot price)
- Maintains existing position_debug column for raw position display
- No changes to PnL calculation logic
- Added unit test `tests/core/test_mermaid_protocol.py` with a dummy subclass to verify MermaidProtocol method outputs

### Scenario Ladder TT API Integration Fix (June 3, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. `scl-demo-mode-store` reference error - added missing demo mode store to layout
  2. TTTokenManager configuration error - fixed parameter passing
  3. Spot price callback demo mode dependency - removed demo mode from spot price to keep PM integration
- **Implementation**:
  - Fixed TTTokenManager initialization to pass app_name and company_name directly
  - Made spot price always use Pricing Monkey automation (not affected by demo mode)
  - Demo mode now only affects working orders data source
  - Added complete demo mode toggle functionality with visual feedback
- **Current State**:

## Recent Fixes

### Scenario Ladder Price Parsing Fix (June 3, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Price parsing in Scenario Ladder failed for bond prices without decimal parts (e.g., "110-17")
- **Root Cause**: The `scl_parse_and_convert_pm_price` function used a restrictive regex pattern that required a decimal part
- **Solution**: Replaced custom parsing logic with the existing robust `parse_treasury_price` function from `lib/trading/common/price_parser.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added imports for `parse_treasury_price` and `decimal_to_tt_bond_format`
  - Simplified `scl_parse_and_convert_pm_price` to use the standard library functions
  - Now handles both formats: "110-17" (without decimal) and "110-17.5" (with decimal)
- **Files Modified**: `apps/dashboards/main/app.py` (import statement and function implementation)

### Scenario Ladder Enhancement (June 3, 2025) 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- **Enhancements Completed**:
  - ✅ Added Demo Mode toggle with fallback to mock data on API failures

  - ✅ Added graceful error handling with automatic fallback to demo data
  - ✅ Demo mode spot price support (returns 110-17 in demo mode)
  - ✅ Enhanced UX with clear mode indication
  
- **Known Issues**:
  - ❌ Syntax error on line 4222 (indentation issue in error handling block)
  - ❌ Main callback needs the demo_mode_data parameter added to signature
  
- **Still To Do**:
  - Fix indentation error in `scl_load_and_display_orders` function
