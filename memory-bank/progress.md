     - Comprehensive SQLite schema for market prices, trades, snapshots, EOD summaries
     - Time-based price selection (3pm/5pm EST rules)
     - Automatic price source detection (px_last vs px_settle)
     - Full CRUD operations with monitoring
  
  2. **File Watcher** (`watcher.py`):
     - Watchdog-based real-time monitoring
     - Debounced event handling
     - Processes existing files on startup
     - Separate handlers for trades and market prices
  
  3. **P&L Service** (`service.py`):
     - Orchestrates calculator, storage, and file watching
     - Immediate P&L calculation on trade addition
     - Automatic EOD snapshot at 5pm EST
     - Time zone handling (Chicago for trades, EST for prices)
     - Per-date calculator instances for daily isolation
  
  4. **Mock Data Generation**:
     - XCME format matching trade CSV structure
     - Futures and options with proper exchange codes (VY/WY/ZN)
     - 3pm and 5pm price files for testing
  
- **Test Results**:
  - Successfully processes trade CSVs with daily naming convention
  - Calculates live P&L immediately upon trade update
  - Stores snapshots and EOD summaries
  - Handles missing market prices with fallback to trade prices
  - File watching works for real-time updates

### February 4, 2025 - P&L Calculator CSV Loading Implementation
- **Task**: Add CSV loading capability to P&L Calculator module
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Requirement**: Read trades from progressive trade ledger CSV file
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added `load_trades_from_csv()` method to PnLCalculator class
    - CSV format: tradeId, instrumentName, marketTradeTime, buySell, quantity, price
    - Instrument names preserved as-is (no parsing required)
    - Trade direction conversion: 'B' → positive quantity, 'S' → negative quantity
    - Timestamp parsing handles "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm" format
  - **Validation Features**:
    - Checks for required columns before processing
    - Validates buySell values (must be 'B' or 'S')
    - Handles missing or malformed data gracefully
    - Comprehensive error logging
  - **Documentation**: Updated io-schema.md with CSV format specifications

### February 4, 2025 - P&L Calculator Module Implementation

### January 23, 2025 - Spot Risk Futures Greek Hardcoding
- **Task**: Set hardcoded Greek values for futures positions in spot risk processing
- **Status**: ✅ Complete  
- **Details**:
  - **Requirement**: Futures should have delta_F=63.0 and gamma_F=0.0042
  - **Implementation**:
    - Modified `SpotRiskGreekCalculator.calculate_greeks()` method
    - Added futures processing section after options Greek calculation
    - Futures now get hardcoded values (not calculated via API)
  - **Greek Values Set**:
    - delta_F = 63.0 (hardcoded)
    - gamma_F = 0.0042 (hardcoded)
    - delta_y and gamma_y calculated using DV01 conversion
    - All other Greeks set to 0.0 (appropriate for futures)
  - **Technical**: Handles different column formats (itype='F', Instrument Type='FUTURE')
  - **Testing**: Created test scripts to verify correct values applied

### January 23, 2025 - NET_FUTURES Aggregation Implementation
- **Task**: Add NET_FUTURES row to CSV during processing that sums futures positions and Greeks
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Requirement**: Create a single row summing all futures with non-zero positions
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added `calculate_aggregates()` method to `SpotRiskGreekCalculator`
    - Modified file_watcher to call calculate_aggregates before saving CSV
    - NET_FUTURES row only includes futures with position != 0
  - **Calculation Logic**:
    - Positions: Direct sum of all non-zero futures positions
    - Greeks: Simple addition of Greek values (not position-weighted)
    - Handles NaN values properly in summation (skipna=True)
    - Clears non-applicable fields (strike, bid, ask, etc.)
  - **Technical Notes**:
    - Handles case sensitivity for column names (position/po, itype variations)
    - Sets appropriate metadata (itype='NET', model_version='net_aggregate')
    - Robust error handling for missing position columns
    - **Fixed**: Added support for 'pos.position' column (lowercase from parser)
  - **Testing**: Verified with synthetic data and full pipeline test
  - **Bug Fix**: Updated to handle 'pos.position' column name from parsed CSV files

### January 21, 2025 - Spot Risk Dashboard Greek Profiles by Expiry
- **Task**: Enhance Greek profile graphs to group by expiry date
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Requirement**: Each expiry should have its own Greek profile graphs
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added `generate_greek_profiles_by_expiry()` method to controller
    - Each expiry group calculates its own ATM strike
    - Model parameters (sigma, tau) extracted per expiry
    - Graphs organized with clear expiry headers
  - **UI Enhancements**:
    - Expiry section headers show: date, position count, net position, ATM
    - Graph titles include expiry for clarity
    - Sorted expiry display for consistency
  - **Technical**: Maintains MVC separation with controller handling grouping logic

### January 21, 2025 - Spot Risk Dashboard Greek Profiles Complete
- **Task**: Complete implementation of Greek profile graphs in Spot Risk Dashboard
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Initial Issues**: Multiple rendering problems prevented graphs from displaying
  - **Root Cause Found**: Structural issue - graph container was nested inside table container
  - **Solution Path**:
    1. Fixed NaN handling in strike calculations
    2. Added proper .render() calls to Graph components
    3. Moved Graph import to module level
    4. Made graph container a sibling of table container (key fix)
    5. Restored full Greek profile generation code
  - **Result**: Greek profile graphs now display correctly with:
    - Dynamic generation based on selected Greek checkboxes
    - ±5 strike range from ATM with 0.25 increments
    - Position markers sized by position size
    - ATM strike indicator line
    - Error handling with placeholder graph fallback

### January 21, 2025 - Spot Risk CSV Parser Fix
- **Task**: Fix "No valid future price found" error when processing new spot risk CSV files
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Issue**: Greek calculations failing for new dataset `bav_analysis_20250709_193912.csv`
  - **Root Cause**: Parser using `skiprows=[1]` for all CSV files, accidentally skipping future row in processed files
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - Modified parser to conditionally skip rows based on filename
    - Processed files (containing 'processed') don't skip any rows
    - Original files skip row 1 (type row in original format)
  - **Result**: Future row with `itype='F'` correctly parsed, Greek calculations working
  - **Technical Note**: Legacy code assumption about CSV format caused parsing issue

### January 21, 2025 - Spot Risk Dashboard Structural Fix
- **Task**: Fix graph container not displaying when switching to graph view
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Issue**: Graphs not visible despite successful generation and no errors
  - **Root Cause**: Structural issue - spot-risk-graph-container was a child of spot-risk-table-container
  - **Impact**: When toggle callback hid table container, it also hid the nested graph container
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - Made spot-risk-graph-container a sibling of spot-risk-table-container
    - Both containers are now direct children of the Loading component
    - Proper separation allows independent visibility control
  - **Technical Note**: Common mistake when organizing view hierarchies in Dash

### January 21, 2025 - Spot Risk Dashboard Graph Render Fix
- **Task**: Fix graph not displaying - add missing .render() method
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Issue**: Graphs still not visible despite successful generation
  - **Root Cause**: Graph component created without calling .render() method
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - Added `.render()` call to Graph component: `Graph(...).render()`
    - Matches pattern used throughout main app.py
    - All wrapped UI components require .render() to generate Dash elements
  - **Technical Note**: This is the correct pattern for UIKitX wrapped components

### January 21, 2025 - Spot Risk Dashboard Graph Import Fix
- **Task**: Fix graph rendering issue - graphs not visible despite successful generation
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Issue**: Graphs generated successfully but not rendering in browser
  - **Root Cause**: Graph component imported inside callback instead of at module level
  - **Solution Implemented**:
    - Moved `from lib.components.advanced.graph import Graph` to top of callbacks.py
    - Matches pattern used in other working dashboards (e.g., actant_preprocessing)
    - Resolves potential React component registration issues
  - **Technical Note**: Component imports inside callbacks can cause module loading and reconciliation issues

### January 20, 2025 - Spot Risk Parser Implementation

    - bav_analysis_20250708_104022.csv → data/input/actant_spot_risk/
  - Updated memory bank documentation

### January 20, 2025 - Time to Expiry (vtexp) Implementation
- **Task**: Add time to expiry calculation using bachelier logic with CSV timestamp
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - Enhanced bachelier.py with `time_to_expiry_years()` function:
    - Accepts evaluation_datetime parameter instead of using current time
    - Calculates business minutes excluding CME holidays
    - Returns fraction of business year (minutes / 1440 / 252)
  - Created time_calculator.py module:
    - `parse_series_from_key()` - Extract VY/WY/ZN from instrument keys
    - `build_expiry_datetime()` - Apply CME time conventions (VY/WY: 14:00, ZN: 16:30)

- **Result**: Enhanced visibility into critical trading workflows with minimal performance impact

### Performance Optimization: Strategic @monitor Removal (January 6, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Dashboard performance severely degraded by @monitor overhead on low-level functions
- **Root Cause**: 
  - @monitor adds ~50μs overhead per call
  - Functions called in tight loops causing exponential slowdown
  
#### Greek Analysis Optimization:
- **Problem**: Taking 53+ seconds due to mathematical functions called 1000+ times
- **Functions optimized**:
  - **bachelier_greek.py**: 7 math functions (bachelier_price, analytical_greeks, etc.)
  - **numerical_greeks.py**: 2 calculation functions (compute_derivatives, compute_derivatives_bond_future)
  - **pricing_engine.py**: 30 Greek calculation methods
- **Result**: Greek Analysis reduced from 53+ seconds to < 5 seconds

#### Actant EOD Optimization:
- **Problem**: Data loading taking ~21 seconds with `_try_convert_to_float` called 432 times
- **Functions optimized**:
  - **data_service.py**: 6 low-level functions removed @monitor from:
    - `_try_convert_to_float` (432 calls during load)
    - `_parse_point_header` (string parsing)
    - `_transform_bs_delta`, `_transform_bs_gamma`, `_transform_bs_vega` (math operations)
    - `_quote_column_name` (string manipulation)
- **Result**: EOD data loading reduced from ~21 seconds to < 2 seconds

- **Total Impact**: 45 @monitor decorators removed, ~90% performance improvement across dashboards

### Greek Validation Implementation (January 17, 2025) 🔢 COMPLETE
- **Objective**: Extend Greek Analysis dashboard to display numerical Greeks alongside analytical ones
- **Status**: Step 1 Complete - Core numerical calculation module created
- **Module Created**: `lib/trading/bond_future_options/numerical_greeks.py`
  - Finite difference engine for up to 3rd order derivatives
  - Adaptive step sizes for F, sigma, and time parameters
  - Proper Greek name mapping (numerical → analytical conventions)
  - Error handling for edge cases (T→0, σ→0, ATM)
- **Validation Results**:
  - First-order Greeks match analytical perfectly (0.00% error)
  - Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta all validated
  - Higher-order Greeks differ by design (analytical uses Bachelier formulas, numerical uses pure derivatives)
  - Calculation time: ~2-3ms for full Greek set
- **Key Finding**: Mismatch is expected, not an error
  - Analytical volga = vega * d * (d²-1) / sigma (Bachelier-specific)
  - Numerical volga = ∂²V/∂σ² (pure mathematical derivative)
  - Factor difference: ~24x for volga, ~25x for speed
- **Step Size Investigation**: Tested 10 different step sizes (1e-8 to 1.0)
  - No step size bridges the gap (best still ~96% error)
  - Step sizes 1e-4 to 1e-2 all converge to same numerical values
  - Created detailed findings document: numerical_greeks_findings.md
- **Pivoted to Greek Validation**: After discovering finite differences calculate pure derivatives while analytical Greeks use model-specific formulas
- **Created Greek PnL Validator**: 
  - `lib/trading/bond_future_options/greek_validator.py` - Complete validation framework
  - Tests how well analytical Greeks predict actual price changes
  - Achieved R² = 0.90 with second-order Taylor expansion
- **Key Technical Findings**:
  - Greek scaling requires careful handling (some multiplied by 1000, others not)
  - Greek contributions: Delta 37%, Theta 39%, Gamma 21%, Vega 4% (near-ATM)
  - Second-order terms improve predictions significantly (R² 0.74 → 0.90)
- **Documentation Created**: 
  - `numerical_greeks_findings.md` - Investigation of finite difference limitations
  - `greek_validation_findings.md` - Complete validation results and recommendations

### Future Enhancement: Distributed Tracing (Phase 9+) 🔮 FUTURE - CRITICAL
- **Current Behavior**: Each @monitor decorated function creates independent traces
  - Nested/child function calls get separate trace_ids
  - No parent-child relationships tracked
  - Call hierarchy must be inferred from timestamps
  
- **Critical Design Requirements** (When We Return to This):
  - **Parent-Child Tracking**: Carefully devise system to maintain call hierarchy
    - Use Python's `contextvars` to create thread-local trace context
    - Parent trace_id propagated to ALL child calls within execution context
    - Support for async/await and thread boundaries
    - Handle generator functions that may execute across multiple parent contexts
  - **Trace Context Propagation**:
    - Root spans: Functions called from non-monitored code get new trace_id
    - Child spans: Functions called from monitored code inherit parent trace_id
    - Cross-service: Support trace headers for distributed systems
  - **Data Model Enhancement**:
    - Add `parent_trace_id` and `root_trace_id` columns
    - Add `span_id` for unique identification within a trace
    - Add `depth` field for nesting level
    - Consider adding `follows_from` for async relationships
  
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Create `TraceContext` class using contextvars.ContextVar
  - Modify @monitor to check/create/propagate context
  - Database schema migration with new relationship fields
  - Query optimization for trace tree reconstruction
  - UI components for call tree visualization
  
- **Why This Matters**:
  - Debug complex flows across multiple services
  - Identify performance bottlenecks in call chains
  - Understand true cost of operations (inclusive time)
  - Track async operations and their relationships

- **Fixed**: Resolved duplicate callback outputs error by consolidating shock amount options logic into single callback

### Scenario Ladder Range Enhancement
- Modified `scenario_ladder_v1.py` to enhance ladder price range generation:
  - The ladder now always includes the current spot price. If the spot is outside the range of working orders, the ladder expands to include it.
  - Added one extra price increment (tick) as padding at both the top and bottom of the calculated price range.
- Adjusted logic for determining ladder boundaries to consider both processed working orders and the spot price before rounding and padding.
- Ensured early exits for "no data" scenarios correctly account for the availability of spot price.

### Mock Spot Price Implementation
- Added mock spot price (110'085) in scenario_ladder_v1.py for use when USE_MOCK_DATA is True
- Mock spot price is parsed and initialized at application start-up
- Initial spot-price-store is populated with mock values when in mock mode
- Refresh Data button returns mock spot price when in mock mode without making external calls
- Updated docstrings and comments to document this behavior

### Position Calculation Update in Scenario Ladder
- Modified how the position_debug field is calculated in scenario_ladder_v1.py
- Position now reflects accumulated position AFTER orders at that price level are executed
- Projected PnL calculation remains unchanged, still using position BEFORE orders at the current level
- Improves clarity by showing the "post-execution" position at each price level
- Updated all relevant documentation and code comments

### Mermaid Tab UI Enhancements
- Removed the "Diagram Visualization" header from the mermaid tab
- Added a second mermaid diagram showing TT REST API architecture
- Organized both diagrams in separate grid containers for better visual separation
- Provided more comprehensive visualization of system data flow

### TT REST API Integration Enhancement
- Updated scenario_ladder_v1.py to use live data from the TT REST API by default instead of mock data 
- Changed USE_MOCK_DATA flag from True to False, enabling direct connection to TT's services
- Verified code path for live data fetching based on existing implementation and log output
- This provides a more accurate picture of current market orders without requiring manual data updates

### Risk Calculation Enhancement in Scenario Ladder
- Modified risk column calculation in scenario_ladder_v1.py to multiply position by 15.625
- Risk now represents DV01 risk (dollar value of 1 basis point) rather than raw position
- Applied to both calculation passes (above and below spot price)
- Maintains existing position_debug column for raw position display
- No changes to PnL calculation logic
- Added unit test `tests/core/test_mermaid_protocol.py` with a dummy subclass to verify MermaidProtocol method outputs

### Scenario Ladder TT API Integration Fix (June 3, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. `scl-demo-mode-store` reference error - added missing demo mode store to layout
  2. TTTokenManager configuration error - fixed parameter passing
  3. Spot price callback demo mode dependency - removed demo mode from spot price to keep PM integration
- **Implementation**:
  - Fixed TTTokenManager initialization to pass app_name and company_name directly
  - Made spot price always use Pricing Monkey automation (not affected by demo mode)
  - Demo mode now only affects working orders data source
  - Added complete demo mode toggle functionality with visual feedback
- **Current State**: 
  - Demo Mode: ON by default (uses mock orders from JSON file)
  - Spot Price: Always from Pricing Monkey automation
  - Full ladder visualization with position tracking and P&L calculations
  - Ready for demo with graceful fallback to mock data

## Recent Fixes

### Scenario Ladder Price Parsing Fix (June 3, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Price parsing in Scenario Ladder failed for bond prices without decimal parts (e.g., "110-17")
- **Root Cause**: The `scl_parse_and_convert_pm_price` function used a restrictive regex pattern that required a decimal part
- **Solution**: Replaced custom parsing logic with the existing robust `parse_treasury_price` function from `lib/trading/common/price_parser.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added imports for `parse_treasury_price` and `decimal_to_tt_bond_format`
  - Simplified `scl_parse_and_convert_pm_price` to use the standard library functions
  - Now handles both formats: "110-17" (without decimal) and "110-17.5" (with decimal)
- **Files Modified**: `apps/dashboards/main/app.py` (import statement and function implementation)

### Scenario Ladder Enhancement (June 3, 2025) 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- **Enhancements Completed**:
  - ✅ Added Demo Mode toggle with fallback to mock data on API failures
  - ✅ Fixed TT API configuration error by passing correct parameters to TTTokenManager
  - ✅ Added graceful error handling with automatic fallback to demo data

### Greek Profiles by Expiry Fix (January 21, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Task**: Fix "Found 0 expiry groups: []" error in Greek profiles by expiry
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Issue 1**: Method looking for 'expiry' column but CSV has 'expiry_date'
  - **Issue 2**: KeyError on 'current_greeks' - position data missing Greek values
  - **Root Causes**: 
    1. Column name mismatch in `generate_greek_profiles_by_expiry()` 
    2. Missing 'current_greeks' field in position data structure
    3. Greek column names don't match selected Greek names (e.g., 'delta' vs 'delta_F')
  - **Fixed**:
    1. Updated method to check multiple column names: 'expiry_date', 'expiry', 'Expiry', etc.
    2. Added 'current_greeks' field to position data structure
    3. Created greek_column_map to map selected Greeks to actual columns:
       - 'delta' → 'delta_F' (fallback to 'delta_y')
       - 'gamma' → 'gamma_F' (fallback to 'gamma_y')  
       - 'vega' → 'vega_price' (fallback to 'vega_y')
       - 'theta' → 'theta_F'
       - And mappings for all higher-order Greeks
    4. Fixed model parameter extraction to use correct columns
    5. Position value correctly read from 'pos.position' column
  - **Technical Notes**: 
    - Common issue with CSV data - always check actual column names
    - Data structure consistency is critical between methods
    - Greek naming conventions vary between calculation engines

## In Progress
- Verifying fill price parsing logic is correct for Actant data (from `110'065` format)
- Testing Actant integration with different fill scenarios
- Improving error handling for SQLite database operations

## Known Issues
- Need to extend error handling for malformed Actant data
- Position direction terminology needs to match industry convention (Long/Short vs Buy/Sell)
- SQLite database connection errors might occur if files are locked

## For Investigation

1. Potential memory leak in TraceCpu when used with long-running functions
2. Plotly theme integration issues in dark mode

## Next Tasks

1. Complete integration tests
2. Add more comprehensive dashboard examples
3. Improve error handling in decorators
4. Connect to live Actant data feed when it becomes available
5. Refine visualization of the baseline display
6. Add unit tests for new Actant data processing functions
7. Implement SQLite database schema versioning for future enhancements

- Created `lib/components/factory/` directory with:
  - `component_factory.py` - Main factory class with creation methods
  - `defaults.py` - Default configurations for all component types
  - `templates.py`

## 2025-02-07: Spot Risk Dashboard Phase 1 Quick Fixes

### ✅ Phase 1 Completed - Small, Robust & Verifiable Steps
- **Table Width Fix**: Adjusted container padding to maximize available width
  - Reduced main container padding from 20px to 10px
  - Changed table overflow from 'auto' to 'visible'
  - Table now expands naturally to accommodate all columns
  
- **Midpoint Validation**: Enhanced CSV parser to handle missing bid/ask values
  - Added fallback logic: uses ask if bid missing, bid if ask missing
  - Searches for alternative price columns (price, last, settle, close)
  - Logs detailed warnings about missing prices for debugging
  
- **Export CSV**: Fully functional CSV export
  - Added dcc.Download component to views
  - Exports currently filtered/visible table data
  - Filename includes timestamp (spot_risk_export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv)
  
- **Greek Space Filter**: F-space/Y-space toggle for Greeks
  - Added toggle buttons in View Options
  - Column mapping respects selected space
  - Store tracks current selection
  - Note: Graphs still need to respect filter selection
  
- **Adjtheor as Primary Price Source**: Updated parser to prioritize adjtheor column
  - Parser now uses adjtheor as primary price source
  - Falls back to calculated midpoint (bid+ask)/2 when adjtheor missing
  - Added price_source tracking column to identify price origin
  - Error message column shows warnings when adjtheor not available:
    - "Using calculated midpoint (adjtheor not available)"
    - "Using bid price only (adjtheor not available)"
    - "Using ask price only (adjtheor not available)"
    - "Using [column] price (adjtheor not available)"
  - Helps users identify when theoretical prices are not being used

### ✅ Minimum Price Safeguard Adjustment
- Changed MIN_PRICE_SAFEGUARD from 1/64 (0.015625) to 1/512 (0.001953125)
- Allows deep OTM options to be priced that were previously rejected
- Updated in both api.py and bachelier_v1.py for consistency
- Surgical fix to address overly strict threshold

### ✅ Table Container Width Fix
- Added `width: 'fit-content'` to spot-risk-data-display panel
- Added `minWidth: '100%'` to ensure minimum width when content is small
- Panel now dynamically expands to match table width
- Visual coherence restored - table no longer appears to overflow its container

### ✅ Graph Filters Implementation
- Created `apply_spot_risk_filters()` reusable function to ensure consistency
- Updated table callback to use the shared filter function
- Added filter inputs to graph callback (expiry, type, strike range)
- Graphs now regenerate when filters change in graph view
- Applied same filtering logic to both table and graph views
- Added filter status to graph info text (shows active filters)
- Handles edge case when no data matches filters

## Recent Completed Work

  - Added JSON-based state tracking (`.file_watcher_state.json`)
  - Tracks files by path + modification time + file size
  - Loads state on startup, saves after successful processing
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing filename-based tracking
- **Key Benefits**:
  - No reprocessing of files on restart
  - Survives output directory cleanup
  - Minimal performance impact (lightweight JSON operations)
  - Graceful fallback if state file is corrupted/missing

### Spot Risk Tab Performance Optimization (2025-01-21)
- **Goal**: Replace synchronous Greek calculations with async reading from processed CSV
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `read_processed_greeks()` method to SpotRiskController
  - Modified `process_greeks()` to prioritize reading from processed files
  - Maintained fallback to synchronous calculation for backward compatibility
  - Updated processing script to preserve timestamps in output filenames
  - Successfully processed `bav_analysis_20250709_193912.csv` with current logic
  - Fixed sorting preservation in backend (removed re-sort by 'key')
- **Key Features Applied**:
  - Adjtheor column as primary price source (fallback to midpoint)
  - Minimum price safeguard of 1/512 for deep OTM options
  - Timestamp preservation: input `bav_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` → output `bav_analysis_processed_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
  - Correct sorting order: Futures → Calls → Puts (by expiry, then strike)
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster loading of Greek data
  - Reduced computational overhead
  - Same data accuracy (reading pre-calculated values)
  - Better file tracking with preserved timestamps
  - Intuitive data ordering maintained
- **Files Modified**:
  - `apps/dashboards/spot_risk/controller.py`
