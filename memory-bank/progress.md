# Progress Log

## Phase 1: Symbol Translation & Price Lookup (COMPLETED)

### Symbol Translation Module
- ✅ Created `lib/trading/symbol_translator.py` with full Actant→Bloomberg translation
- ✅ Fixed option symbol day-of-month occurrence calculation (2nd Monday, 3rd Wednesday, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented proper strike formatting (3 decimal places)
- ✅ Added futures support with product mappings (ZN→TY, etc.)
- ✅ Created base symbol extraction for futures price lookup

### Intelligent Price File Selection  
- ✅ Created `lib/trading/pnl_calculator/price_file_selector.py`
- ✅ Implemented time windows (2pm uses PX_LAST, 4pm uses PX_SETTLE)
- ✅ Added fallback logic for missing files
- ✅ Proper Chicago timezone handling

### Integration Testing
- ✅ Symbol translation: 100% success (22/22 trades)
- ✅ Price lookup: 86.4% success (19/22 found, 3 options out of strike range)
- ✅ Trade preprocessing working (SOD detection, expiry detection)

## Phase 2: Data Pipeline Infrastructure (IN PROGRESS)

### Trade Preprocessor Module (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `lib/trading/pnl_calculator/trade_preprocessor.py`
- ✅ Processes raw trade files with symbol translation
- ✅ Detects SOD positions (midnight trades) 
- ✅ Detects option expiries (zero price trades)
- ✅ Converts Buy/Sell to signed quantities
- ✅ Tracks file size/modification time to avoid reprocessing
- ✅ Outputs to `data/output/trade_ledger_processed/`
- ✅ Preserves original trade date in filename

### Trade File Watcher (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `lib/trading/pnl_calculator/trade_file_watcher.py`
- ✅ Monitors trade ledger directory with watchdog
- ✅ Handles file modification events (for growing files)
- ✅ Implements 4pm CDT cutover logic
- ✅ Processes existing files on startup
- ✅ Debouncing to prevent rapid reprocessing

### Testing & Scripts (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created `scripts/run_trade_preprocessor.py` - standalone runner
- ✅ Created `scripts/test_trade_preprocessor.py` - comprehensive tests
- ✅ Verified file change detection works correctly
- ✅ Tested with actual trade files - all features working

### Price Router (TODO)
- ⏳ Need to create price router module
- ⏳ Integrate with price file selector
- ⏳ Handle time-based routing logic

## Phase 3: Storage & State Management (TODO)

### Database Schema
- ⏳ Design schema for trades, positions, P&L
- ⏳ Implement migrations
- ⏳ Add indexes for performance

### State Persistence  
- ⏳ Position tracking across days
- ⏳ Handle SOD positions
- ⏳ Audit trail implementation

## Phase 4: UI Integration (TODO)

### Dashboard Updates
- ⏳ Integrate new calculation engine
- ⏳ Real-time updates
- ⏳ Historical views

## Known Issues

1. **Strike Range Mismatches**: Some option strikes in trades don't exist in price files
2. **3pm Price Files**: Currently ignored per business logic
3. **PowerShell Execution**: Script execution policy warnings (cosmetic)

## Next Steps

1. Create price router module to complete Phase 2
2. Begin Phase 3 with database schema design
3. Integration test full pipeline once Phase 2 complete
