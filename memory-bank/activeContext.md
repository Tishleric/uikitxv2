## Current Focus

Settlement-Aware P&L System Implementation - Pre-Phase 2 Integration Complete

### Project Status

**Phase 1: Settlement-Aware P&L Core (COMPLETED)** ✅
- ✅ Created `settlement_pnl.py` module with clean P&L component tracking
- ✅ Enhanced trade processor to preserve entry/exit timestamps on all lots
- ✅ Integrated settlement calculator into position calculator
- ✅ Implemented proper handling of multi-day positions (entry→settle→settle→exit)
- ✅ Full test coverage for all scenarios (intraday, same-day cross, multi-day)

**Pre-Phase 2: Integration Tasks (COMPLETED)** ✅
- ✅ Fixed TYU5 main.py to use PositionCalculator2 with settlement logic
- ✅ Connected lot breakdown with timestamps through the pipeline
- ✅ Created migration for P&L components table and alerts table
- ✅ Enhanced TYU5DatabaseWriter to persist P&L components
- ✅ Created SettlementPriceLoader to load px_settle from market_prices.db
- ✅ Integrated settlement price loading into TYU5 main flow
- ✅ Added explicit error handling for missing settlement prices (no silent defaults)

**Key Integration Points:**
1. **TYU5 Main Flow**:
   - Now imports and uses SettlementPriceLoader
   - Passes lot details with timestamps to PositionCalculator
   - Loads settlement prices based on trade date range

2. **Database Persistence**:
   - New `tyu5_pnl_components` table stores P&L breakdown by period
   - New `tyu5_alerts` table captures missing price warnings
   - Enhanced position breakdown with entry/exit timestamps

3. **Price Loading**:
   - Handles Bloomberg suffix (TYU5 → "TYU5 Comdty")
   - Reports missing prices explicitly - no silent failures
   - Loads all settlement dates needed for position lifecycle

### Settlement P&L Architecture (Updated)

```python
# Complete integration flow
Trade Files → PnLPipelineWatcher → TradeLedgerAdapter → TYU5 Main
                                                              ↓
                                            TradeProcessor (timestamps)
                                                              ↓
                                    PositionCalculator2 + SettlementPriceLoader
                                                              ↓
                                         Settlement-Aware P&L Components
                                                              ↓
                                            TYU5DatabaseWriter
                                                              ↓
                                    pnl_tracker.db (components + alerts)
```

### Integration Test Results

- ✅ Settlement prices loaded from market_prices.db
- ✅ P&L components calculated with proper settlement splits
- ✅ Missing price alerts generated when prices unavailable
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing code

### Ready for Phase 2: Period Attribution & Filtering

With the integration complete, we can now:
1. Implement trade filtering for 2pm-to-2pm P&L periods
2. Add period parameters to TYU5Service.calculate_pnl()
3. Update EODSnapshotService to use period-filtered calculations
4. Test with real trade data and production scenarios

### Recent Code Additions

**New Modules:**
- `lib/trading/pnl_integration/settlement_price_loader.py` - Loads px_settle from DB
- `scripts/migration/004_add_pnl_components_table.py` - Schema for components

**Updated Modules:**
- `lib/trading/pnl/tyu5_pnl/main.py` - Integrated settlement price loading
- `lib/trading/pnl_integration/tyu5_database_writer.py` - Persists P&L components

### Critical Integration Decisions

1. **No Silent Defaults**: Missing settlement prices are explicitly reported
2. **Bloomberg Format**: Price loader handles symbol suffix automatically
3. **Alerts Table**: Provides audit trail for data quality issues
4. **Run ID Tracking**: P&L components linked to calculation runs
