# Active Context - Spot Risk Integration

## Current Focus
Successfully implemented Greek calculator with robust implied volatility solver for spot risk positions.

## Key Achievements
1. **Parser Implementation** ✅
   - Parses Actant CSV with mixed futures/options
   - Normalizes columns and numeric values
   - Intelligent sorting (futures first, then by expiry/strike)

2. **Time to Expiry Calculation** ✅
   - Integrated bachelier.py logic
   - CME expiry conventions (VY/WY at 14:00, ZN at 16:30)
   - Business year fractions calculated correctly

3. **Greek Calculator with Robust Solver** ✅
   - Fixed convergence issues in Newton-Raphson solver
   - Added iteration limits (100-200 max)
   - Better initial guesses based on moneyness
   - Bounds checking (0.1 to 1000 volatility)
   - Looser tolerance (1e-6) for practical convergence
   - Zero derivative checks prevent division by zero
   - Minimum price safeguards for deep OTM options
   - Successfully calculates all Greeks for 50 options in ~0.5s

## Next Steps
1. Create data service layer with caching and filtering
2. Add 'Spot Risk Monitor' tab to main dashboard
3. Implement DataTable with all positions and Greeks
4. Add filtering controls
5. Create summary cards for total position and net Greeks
6. Implement file watcher for auto-updates
7. Create comprehensive test suite

## Technical Details
- Using bond_future_options API with safeguards
- Default DV01=63.0, convexity=0.0042 for ZN futures  
- Model-View-Controller separation maintained
- All Greek calculations include full suite: delta_F/y, gamma_F/y, vega_price/y, theta_F, volga, vanna, charm, speed, color, ultima, zomma
