## Current Focus
The dashboard refactoring is complete with all 8 navigation items (now 7 after merging Mermaid):
1. ✅ Option Hedging (formerly Pricing Monkey Setup)
2. ✅ Option Comparison (formerly Analysis)
3. ✅ Greek Analysis
4. ✅ Scenario Ladder

- **Namespace Isolation**: Each dashboard uses prefixes (aeod_, scl_, acp_) to prevent ID conflicts
- **Data Architecture**: 6-store pattern for state management
- **Theme Consistency**: Dark theme with accent colors throughout
- **Monitoring**: All callbacks wrapped with trace decorators
- **Interactive Documentation**: File tree with hover tooltips showing code-index descriptions
