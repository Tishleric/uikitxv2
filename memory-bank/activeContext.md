# Active Context & Next Steps

**Current Focus**: Trade Ledger Direct Integration
**Task**: Create adapter to read trade ledger CSV and feed TYU5 directly  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Key Achievements (July 20, 2025)
- Created TradeLedgerAdapter that bypasses legacy database completely
- Implemented robust XCME symbol parsing for futures and options
- Added direct market price fetching using Bloomberg symbols
- Successfully integrated with TYU5 P&L calculation engine

## Implementation Details
1. **Symbol Parsing**: 
   - Handles XCMEFFDPSX futures and XCMEOPADPS options
   - Special case for July 25, 2025 Friday options (OZNQ5)
   - Generates both TYU5 and Bloomberg symbols
2. **Price Fetching**: 
   - Pre-fetches prices from market_prices.db using Bloomberg symbols
   - Bypasses TYU5Adapter's broken symbol translation
   - Uses Prior_Close as fallback when Current_Price is NaN
3. **Data Filtering**: 
   - Filters out zero-price trades on expiry date
   - Includes midnight trades as start-of-day positions
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing TYU5 engine

## Previous Achievements (July 18, 2025)
- Added Current_Price column to futures_prices and options_prices tables  
- Created SpotRiskPriceProcessor to extract ADJTHEOR/BID-ASK midpoint
- Integrated with existing SpotRiskFileHandler for automatic updates
- Successfully tested with 57 prices (1 future, 56 options) updated

## Implementation Details (July 18)
1. **Migration**: Added Current_Price REAL column to both price tables
2. **Price Extraction**: 
   - Primary: ADJTHEOR value from spot risk CSV
   - Fallback: (BID + ASK) / 2 when ADJTHEOR not available
3. **Symbol Translation**: Reused SpotRiskSymbolTranslator for Actant → Bloomberg mapping
4. **Auto-Update**: Hooked into existing file watcher for automatic processing

## Previous Context (M2 Complete)
- ✅ M1 Complete: Symbol mapping and database adapters
- ✅ M2 Complete: Full rebuild working with correct expiry matching
- Created comprehensive verification report
- Documented symbol translation analysis

## Recent Progress
- Automated FULLPNL builder correctly matches options to proper expiries
- Discovered and documented bug in manual scripts (wrong expiry matching)
- Coverage: 100% positions, 75% prices, 62.5% Greeks, 62.5% vtexp
- Missing data explained: strikes 109.5 and 109.75 not in spot risk database

## Key Findings
1. **Automated Builder Correctness**: Our implementation correctly uses contract code mappings:
   - 3MN options → 18JUL25 ✓
   - VBYN options → 21JUL25 ✓
   - TYWN options → 23JUL25 ✓

2. **Manual Script Bug**: Original scripts match all options to 23JUL25 due to:
   - No expiry constraint in query
   - ORDER BY id DESC returns highest ID (which is 23JUL25)
   - This produces incorrect Greeks for 3MN and VBYN options

3. **Symbol Translation**: Identified 5 different symbol translators in codebase
   - Documented in `memory-bank/symbol_translation_analysis.md`
   - Recommend future consolidation into unified service
