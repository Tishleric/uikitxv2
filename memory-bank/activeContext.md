# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Spot Risk Tab Performance Optimization**: Successfully implemented asynchronous reading of pre-calculated Greeks from processed CSV files with correct sorting preserved.

### Completed Work (2025-01-21)
1. **Async Greek Reading Implementation**
   - Added `read_processed_greeks()` method to SpotRiskController
   - Modified `process_greeks()` to prioritize reading from processed files
   - Maintains fallback to synchronous calculation

2. **Timestamp Preservation in Processing**
   - Modified `process_spot_risk_csv()` to preserve timestamps in output filenames
   - Successfully processed `bav_analysis_20250709_193912.csv`
   - Output: `bav_analysis_processed_20250709_193912.csv`

3. **Sorting Fix in Backend**
   - Fixed `test_full_pipeline.py` to preserve parser's sorting order
   - Correct order maintained: Futures → Calls → Puts
   - Within each type: sorted by expiry_date, then strike

4. **Python Path Resolution**
   - Created `run_spot_risk_processing.bat` for consistent Anaconda Python usage
   - Resolved conflict between standalone Python and Anaconda installations

### Key Improvements Applied
- **Adjtheor as Primary Price**: Parser uses adjtheor column first, midpoint as fallback
- **Minimum Price Safeguard**: Set to 1/512 (allows deep OTM options)
- **Async Performance**: Dashboard now reads pre-calculated Greeks for faster loading
- **Correct Data Ordering**: Maintains intuitive sorting (F→C→P, by expiry then strike)

### Next Steps
1. Review dashboard to verify Greek values and sorting match expectations
2. Set up automated processing pipeline (future work)
3. Consider adding version metadata to processed files

## Previous Context

### Benchmark Phase Implementation (Completed)
Performance monitoring infrastructure with SQLite storage and configurable retention:
- Added BenchmarkHandler to logging infrastructure
- Integrated with existing monitoring decorators
- Configurable retention policies per handler type
- Successfully tested with spot_risk dashboard

### Logging System State
- Core handlers: ConsoleHandler, FileHandler, SQLiteHandler, BenchmarkHandler
- All handlers properly integrated and tested
- Retention management working across all handler types
- Dashboard integration via @monitor decorator

### Key Files Modified
- `lib/monitoring/logging/handlers.py`: Added BenchmarkHandler
- `lib/monitoring/logging/config.py`: Added benchmark configuration
- `lib/monitoring/retention/manager.py`: Multi-handler retention support
- `apps/dashboards/spot_risk/controller.py`: Async Greek reading
