# Active Context

## Current Focus
**Spot Risk Automated Processing Pipeline**: Implemented watchdog-based file monitoring for automatic Greek calculation processing.

### Completed Work (2025-01-21)
1. **Async Greek Reading Implementation**
   - Added `read_processed_greeks()` method to SpotRiskController
   - Modified `process_greeks()` to prioritize reading from processed files
   - Maintains fallback to synchronous calculation

2. **Timestamp Preservation in Processing**
   - Modified `process_spot_risk_csv()` to preserve timestamps in output filenames
   - Successfully processed `bav_analysis_20250709_193912.csv`
   - Output: `bav_analysis_processed_20250709_193912.csv`

3. **Sorting Fix in Backend**
   - Fixed `test_full_pipeline.py` to preserve parser's sorting order
   - Correct order maintained: Futures → Calls → Puts
   - Within each type: sorted by expiry_date, then by strike

4. **Watchdog File Monitoring**
   - Created `SpotRiskFileHandler` with file event handling
   - Implemented `SpotRiskWatcher` service for continuous monitoring
   - Features:
     - Automatic detection of new `bav_analysis_*.csv` files
     - File debouncing (waits for stable file size)
     - Duplicate detection (tracks processed files)
     - Processes existing unprocessed files on startup
     - Graceful error handling and logging
   - Created run scripts with Anaconda Python integration

### Key Features Applied
- Adjtheor column as primary price source (fallback to midpoint)
- Minimum price safeguard of 1/512 for deep OTM options
- Correct sorting preserved throughout pipeline
- Timestamp preservation in output filenames
- Automatic processing with watchdog monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Test the watchdog service with live file drops
2. Consider integration with main dashboard (optional)
3. Add monitoring metrics for processing throughput

## Previous Context

### Benchmark Phase Implementation (Completed)
Performance monitoring infrastructure with SQLite storage and configurable retention:
- Added BenchmarkHandler to logging infrastructure
- Integrated with existing monitoring decorators
- Configurable retention policies per handler type
- Successfully tested with spot_risk dashboard

### Logging System State
- Core handlers: ConsoleHandler, FileHandler, SQLiteHandler, BenchmarkHandler
- All handlers properly integrated and tested
- Retention management working across all handler types
- Dashboard integration via @monitor decorator

### Key Files Modified
- `lib/monitoring/logging/handlers.py`: Added BenchmarkHandler
- `lib/monitoring/logging/config.py`: Added benchmark configuration
- `lib/monitoring/retention/manager.py`: Multi-handler retention support
- `apps/dashboards/spot_risk/controller.py`: Async Greek reading
