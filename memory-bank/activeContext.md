# Active Context

## Current Focus: Observability System Implementation

### Overview
Building a comprehensive observability system using Python decorators to monitor all function calls, capturing inputs/outputs in SQLite, and displaying via Dash UI.

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Foundation First**: Get core decorator + queue + storage perfect before UI
2. **Smart Serialization**: Handle all data types gracefully with size limits
3. **Performance Target**: <50µs decorator overhead (realistic)
4. **Retention**: 6-hour hot storage in SQLite, Phase 3 cold storage to S3

### Implementation Plan Location
- Master plan: `memory-bank/PRDeez/observability-implementation-plan.md`
- Original brief: `memory-bank/PRDeez/logsystem.md`

### Next Steps (Week 1)
1. [ ] Create `lib/monitoring/decorators/monitor.py` 
2. [ ] Implement smart serializer in `lib/monitoring/serializers/smart.py`
3. [ ] Build queue + batch writer
4. [ ] Set up SQLite schema
5. [ ] Decorate 3 high-risk functions for testing

### Architecture Summary
```
@monitor → Queue(10k) → BatchWriter(10Hz) → SQLite → Dash UI
```

### Previous Work
- Existing decorators in `lib/monitoring/decorators/` (TraceTime, TraceCpu, etc.)
- Will be deprecated with shim functions pointing to new @monitor

## Legacy Focus Areas (Still Active)

### Actant PnL Dashboard
- Location: `apps/dashboards/actant_pnl/`
- Status: Complete and functional
- Analysis: Excel formulas mapped in `memory-bank/actant_pnl/analysis/`

### Trading System Components
- Ladder test scenarios
- Pricing Monkey automation
- TT REST API integration

## Current Status
- **Project State**: Production-ready unified dashboard with 7 fully integrated tabs
- **Last Action**: Completed final Scenario Ladder adjustments for demo
- **Active Task**: COMPLETED - All dashboards operational and demo-ready

## Recent Work Completed
1. **Actant PnL Dashboard Integration Fix** ✅
   - Fixed double-click navigation issue by registering callbacks at app startup
   - Callbacks now registered before layout rendering (prevents Dash timing issue)
   - All toggle buttons (Graph/Table, Call/Put) working correctly
   - Dashboard loads immediately on first click in sidebar
   - Successfully integrated with main app's sidebar navigation
   - Preserved all functionality from standalone version
   
2. **Scenario Ladder Final Demo Adjustments** ✅
   - Removed green border styling for above/below spot prices
   - Verified blue/red color coding for buy/sell orders
   - Confirmed mathematical accuracy of all calculations
   - Demo mode ON by default with mock data
   
3. **Scenario Ladder Complete Feature Set** ✅
   - Demo Mode ON by default (uses mock orders from JSON)
   - Live spot price fetching via Pricing Monkey automation
   - Complete ladder visualization with price levels
   - Position tracking and P&L calculations
   - Risk metrics (DV01) and breakeven analysis
   - Actant SOD baseline integration
   - Professional UI with dark theme consistency

## System Overview
All 8 dashboards are now fully operational:
1. **Option Hedging** - Pricing Monkey automation
2. **Option Comparison** - Market movement analysis
3. **Greek Analysis** - CTO-validated options pricing
4. **Scenario Ladder** - Trading ladder with TT API ✅ DEMO-READY
5. **Actant EOD** - End-of-day analytics (placeholder)
6. **Actant PnL** - Option pricing comparison (Actant vs Taylor Series) ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED
7. **Project Documentation** - Interactive docs
8. **Logs** - Performance monitoring

## Next Steps
- System is ready for demonstration
- All core functionality is operational
- Consider adding more content to Actant EOD dashboard when needed

## Current Focus
The dashboard refactoring is complete with all 8 navigation items:
1. ✅ Option Hedging (formerly Pricing Monkey Setup)
2. ✅ Option Comparison (formerly Analysis)
3. ✅ Greek Analysis
4. ✅ Scenario Ladder  
5. ✅ Actant EOD
6. ✅ Actant PnL (NEW - fully integrated)
7. ✅ Project Documentation (now includes Mermaid diagrams)
8. ✅ Logs

## Architecture Highlights
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Professional fixed sidebar with icon + label design
- **Namespace Isolation**: Each dashboard uses prefixes (aeod_, scl_, acp_) to prevent ID conflicts
- **Data Architecture**: 6-store pattern for state management
- **Theme Consistency**: Dark theme with accent colors throughout
- **Monitoring**: All callbacks wrapped with trace decorators
- **Interactive Documentation**: File tree with hover tooltips showing code-index descriptions

## Key Files Modified
- `apps/dashboards/main/app.py` - Fixed Actant PnL callback registration timing to prevent double-click issue
- Early callback registration now happens after app initialization, before layout creation

## Testing Notes
- Price parsing now handles all TT bond price formats
- Scenario Ladder successfully loads orders from TT API
- Actant data integration working with both CSV and SQLite sources
- P&L calculations match expected behavior
- UI styling and indicators working correctly
