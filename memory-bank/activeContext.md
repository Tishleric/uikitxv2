# Active Context: Dashboard UI Refinement

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-06-23)
**Table view error fixed: Removed invalid page_action parameter, tables now show all rows without pagination**

### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ **Removed 11 individual Greek graphs** - The original 4x3 grid of individual Greeks has been removed
2. ✅ **Fixed callback errors** - Removed references to non-existent containers in callback
3. ✅ **Greek Profile Analysis remains** - The enhanced Greek profile visualization with all 12 Greeks stays
4. ✅ **Implemented table view for Greek profiles** - All 12 Greek profiles now have table views
5. ✅ **Added table view for Taylor approximation** - Taylor error analysis also has table view
6. ✅ **Proper view toggling** - Graph/Table toggle works correctly with new callback structure
7. ✅ **Fixed Container ID errors** - Added missing id parameters to Container components in table generation
8. ✅ **Removed table pagination** - Tables now show all data rows without pagination
   - Removed sampling logic (was showing every 5th point, now shows all points)  
   - Fixed DataTable error by removing invalid `page_action` parameter
   - Set `page_size=len(table_rows)` to show all rows without pagination
   - Removed fixed height constraints to allow full scrolling
9. ✅ **Hide graphs when table view is active** - Greek profile graphs and Taylor graph are hidden in table view
   - Wrapped Greek Profile Analysis and Taylor sections in new container (acp-greek-profile-graphs-container)
   - Updated toggle callback to control visibility of all three containers
   - Graph view shows: graph container + Greek profile graphs
   - Table view shows: table container only (hides Greek profile graphs)

### Implementation Details

#### View Updates
- Commented out the 11 individual Greek graph containers in the layout
- Updated callback to remove 11 Outputs for non-existent containers  
- Removed code that created empty divs for these graphs
- Dashboard now loads without errors

#### Table View Implementation
- Added new callback `acp_generate_table_view` that generates tables when in table view mode
- Added `profile_data` and `taylor_data` to store_data for table generation
- Tables display the same data as graphs (analytical and numerical values)
- Every 5th data point is shown to keep tables manageable
- Proper formatting with DataTable components in 4x3 grid layout
- Taylor approximation error table included at bottom of table view
- Table/Graph toggle determines which view to show

#### Why Tables Are Valuable
The table view provides complementary functionality to the graphs:
- **Precise Values**: Exact numerical Greek values at specific future prices
- **Side-by-side Comparison**: Easy comparison of analytical vs numerical calculations
- **Data Export Ready**: Table format makes it easy to copy values for further analysis
- **Accessibility**: Better for users who prefer numerical data over visual representations
- **Reference Points**: Clear identification of Greek values at specific price levels

#### Data Flow
1. Main callback calculates all Greek data and stores in `store_data`
2. View toggle callback switches between graph and table containers
3. Table generation callback creates tables when table view is selected
4. Tables use exact same data as graphs with same scaling and adjustments

### Status
The dashboard is now stable and running at http://localhost:8052/
- Greek Analysis page loads without errors
- Greek profile graphs show all 12 Greeks with analytical and numerical values
- Taylor approximation error analysis is displayed
- Table view shows placeholder 4x3 grid

### Original Greek Integration Project Summary
Successfully completed the complete replacement of Greek calculation system with CTO-approved Bachelier implementation from `lib/trading/bond_future_options/bachelier_greek.py`. The main dashboard maintains 100% UI compatibility while now using the new, more comprehensive Greek calculations.

### Final Integration Results

#### Phase 1 - Missing Greeks Implementation ✅
- Added `third_order_greeks()` function to bachelier_greek.py
- Implemented ultima (∂³V/∂σ³) and zomma (∂³V/∂F²∂σ)
- Fixed theta sign convention to be negative (time decay)
- Verified calculations match pricing_engine.py to 1e-8 precision

#### Phase 2 - Core Integration ✅
- Created `_get_all_bachelier_greeks()` centralized access method
- Replaced first 5 Greek methods (delta_y, gamma_y, vega_y, theta_F, volga_price)
- Maintained all scaling factors and DV01 adjustments
- Fixed vega formula bug in analytical_greeks

#### Phase 3 - Complete Integration ✅
- Replaced remaining 6 Greek methods (vanna_F_price, charm_F, speed_F, color_F, ultima, zomma)
- Refactored bachelier_greek.py to separate data generation from visualization
- Created comprehensive dashboard enhancement plan
- Verified all 11 Greeks calculate correctly

#### Phase 4 - Diagnostic Pass & UI Fixes ✅
- **Missing Greeks Investigation**: Discovered `generate_greek_profiles_data()` was only returning 7 Greeks
- **Root Cause**: Function wasn't calling `third_order_greeks()` or `cross_effects()`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated function to include all 12 Greeks (adding ultima, zomma, vanna, charm, veta)
- **Taylor Plot Fix**: Changed y-axis from logarithmic to linear scale for better readability
- **Formula Investigation**: Documented significant differences between analytical and reference formulas:
  - First-order Greeks: Perfect alignment ✅
  - Cross-derivatives: Different methods (finite differences vs analytical)
  - Higher-order Greeks: Significant formula differences (e.g., zomma missing (d²-3) term)

### Architecture Highlights

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All Greek calculations now use bachelier_greek.py
2. **API Compatibility**: Zero changes to method signatures or return types
3. **Scaling Preserved**: All original scaling factors maintained exactly
4. **Clean Module**: bachelier_greek.py is now importable without side effects

### Dashboard Greeks (11 Total)
```python
# Y-Space Greeks (with DV01 adjustments)
'delta_y'        # Delta (Y-Space) - DV01 adjusted
'gamma_y'        # Gamma (Y-Space) - DV01² + convexity adjusted
'vega_y'         # Vega (Y-Space) - DV01 adjusted

# F-Space Greeks
'theta_F'        # Theta (F-Space) - Daily conversion /252
'volga_price'    # Volga (Price Vol)
'vanna_F_price'  # Vanna (F-Price)
'charm_F'        # Charm (F-Space)
'speed_F'        # Speed (F-Space)
'color_F'        # Color (F-Space)

# Third-Order Greeks
'ultima'         # Ultima (∂³V/∂σ³)
'zomma'          # Zomma (∂³V/∂F²∂σ)
```

### Data Generation Functions Available
```python
# For UI integration
generate_greek_profiles_data(K, sigma, tau, F_range, num_points)  # Now includes all 12 Greeks
generate_taylor_summary_data(F0, K, sigma0, tau, dF, dSigma, dTau)
generate_taylor_error_data(K, sigma, tau, dF, dSigma, dTau, F_range)
```

### Next Steps (Formula Alignment Strategy)
1. Evaluate impact of formula differences on risk management
2. Consider aligning with reference implementation for consistency
3. Test both approaches with real market data
4. Document chosen approach and rationale

## Project Complete
The Greek integration project is complete. All 11 Greeks are now calculated using the new bachelier_greek.py implementation with 100% backward compatibility maintained. UI improvements have been implemented to show all available Greeks and improve error visualization.
