# Active Development Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on a complete UI component library with performance tracing and logging functionality. We have:

1. A core set of UI components inheriting from BaseComponent
2. A suite of decorators for tracing and logging function execution 
3. A lumberjack module for logging configuration and SQLite persistence
4. Test suites for all components, decorators, and lumberjack modules

## Current Development Constraints
- All new code must pass mypy --strict and ruff linting
- New components must inherit from BaseComponent
- Decorators must follow the established pattern of using context variables
- Direct imports are used throughout (e.g., `from components import Button`)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Create integration tests for decorators working together
2. Add performance benchmarks for the logging system
3. Enhance the component library with additional UI elements
4. Improve documentation with common usage patterns
5. Consider creating a comprehensive example application

## Recent Updates (May 5, 2025)
- Restructured package to use flat import structure under src/
- Simplified imports to use direct references rather than namespace
- Updated all memory bank documentation to reflect current structure

## Recent Updates (Latest)
- Updated scenario_ladder_v1.py to use live data from the TT REST API by default instead of mock data, improving the relevance of the ladder visualization
