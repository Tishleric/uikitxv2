## Current Phase: Robustness Improvements (8/10 → 10/10)
**Status**: Phase B Complete! Moving to Phase C

### Just Completed: Phase B - Circuit Breaker Implementation ✅

Implemented simple, robust circuit breaker pattern:

1. **CircuitBreaker Class** ✅
   - Three states: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN
   - Configurable thresholds and timeouts
   - Thread-safe with comprehensive stats
   - Clear error messages

2. **SQLite Writer Protection** ✅
   - Integrated circuit breaker into BatchWriter
   - Prevents cascading failures on DB errors

   - System remains stable under failure

3. **Testing** ✅
   - 10 unit tests for circuit breaker
   - Integration tests with observability
   - Demo script showing real protection

### Next: Phase C - Performance Guidelines

Create documentation for performance optimization:
- Document SQLite bottleneck (1,089 ops/sec)
- Best practices for high-frequency monitoring
- Batch size and drain interval tuning
- When to use sampling rates

### Overall Robustness Progress

✅ **Phase A: Memory Pressure** - 8 tests, all passing
✅ **Phase B: Circuit Breaker** - Protecting against DB failures  
🔄 **Phase C: Performance Guide** - Next (1 hour)
⏳ **Phase D: Edge Cases Doc** - Final step

### Recent Achievements

1. **Memory Pressure Handling** ✅
   - SmartSerializer truncates large objects
   - Queue uses ring buffer for overflow
   - FastSerializer has lazy evaluation
   - System gracefully degrades, no OOM

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** ✅
   - Prevents cascading failures
   - Automatic recovery with timeout
   - Statistics for monitoring
   - Clear state transitions

### Key Insight

We're achieving 10/10 robustness through **simple, well-tested solutions**:
- Memory: Truncate and summarize (not complex streaming)
- Failures: Circuit breaker (not complex retry logic)
- Performance: Document limits (not promise infinity)

The goal is to handle what we claim perfectly and be honest about limitations.

## Current Phase: Phase 8 - Production Hardening (Track Everything)
**Status**: Task 4 Complete! (4/5 tasks done)

### Just Completed: Task 4 - Retention Management ✅

Implemented simple, robust retention management:

1. **RetentionManager** ✅
   - Simple DELETE operations for 6-hour rolling window
   - No VACUUM operations (avoid spikes in 24/7 markets)
   - WAL mode for better concurrency
   - Steady state reached after 6 hours

2. **RetentionController** ✅
   - Background thread runs cleanup every 60 seconds
   - Graceful error handling with exponential backoff
   - Thread-safe statistics and monitoring
   - Manual cleanup trigger for testing

3. **Integration** ✅
   - Integrated with start_observability_writer()
   - Optional retention_enabled parameter
   - Configurable retention_hours
   - Zero breaking changes

4. **Testing** ✅
   - 23 unit tests (all passing)
   - Integration tests with real data
   - Demo script showing steady state behavior
   - Stress tested concurrent operations

5. **Documentation** ✅
   - Created comprehensive `retention-implementation-summary.md`
   - Updated all memory bank files
   - Added to code-index and io-schema

### Implementation Philosophy

We chose the **simplest approach** after careful analysis:
- No complex partitioning schemes
- No incremental vacuum (fragility risk)
- Just DELETE + let SQLite handle the rest
- 15% overhead acceptable for robustness

This aligns with our "no shortcuts" principle - simple solutions thoroughly tested are better than complex solutions with edge cases.

### Key Achievement
Database reaches **steady state** after 6 hours where deletions equal insertions. No manual intervention needed, no performance spikes, perfect for 24/7 trading.

### Robustness Score: 8/10 → 10/10 Plan

**Current Score: 8/10** (was 6/10 at start of day)

**Simple 1-Day Plan to Reach 10/10**:
1. **Memory Pressure Tests** (2 hours) - Simple resource limit tests
2. **Basic Circuit Breaker** (3 hours) - 50 lines to prevent cascading failures  
3. **Performance Guide** (1 hour) - Document when to use sampling
4. **Unsupported Patterns Doc** (1 hour) - Be clear about the 1% we don't handle

**Key Insight**: 10/10 doesn't mean handling everything - it means handling what we claim perfectly and being honest about limitations.

### Current Focus: Task 4 - Retention Management
Need to implement:
- RetentionManager with configurable retention (default: 6 hours)
- Partitioned tables by hour for efficient cleanup
- Auto-cleanup thread running every 60 seconds
- Database VACUUM on low-activity periods
- Archive option for compliance (compress old data)

### Known Issues & Future Work:
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - SQLite writer bottleneck documented
   - Solution: Use sampling for hot paths
   - Alternative: Document when to use ClickHouse/TimescaleDB
   
2. **Deferred Work** (Intentional):
   - Intelligent process groups (implement during UI phase)
   - Complex distributed tracing (YAGNI for now)

### Next Steps:
1. Implement 1-day robustness plan (optional but recommended)
2. Continue with RetentionManager (Task 4)
3. Create Dash UI for observability (Task 5)
4. Production deployment guide

### Process Groups Understanding
Process groups serve as logical categorization for monitored functions:
- **Auto-derivation**: Uses module name if not specified ✅
- **Custom grouping**: Can override for business logic organization ✅
- **Future**: Intelligent assignment strategies designed but deferred

### Philosophy Maintained
- **Track Everything**: 100% observability by default ✅
- **Errors Are Sacred**: Never dropped, unlimited queue ✅
- **Production First**: Robustness over features ✅
- **Be Honest**: Document what we don't support ✅

### Development Notes
- All comprehensive tests passing (40+ tests)
- Zero breaking changes from today's improvements
- Documentation updated in real-time
- Ready for production use with known limitations

## Key Achievement
The observability system now embodies the "Track Everything" philosophy perfectly. A single @monitor() decorator with zero configuration captures all metrics by default. Today we made it significantly more robust without breaking anything or overcomplicating the design.

## Current Focus: Observability System Implementation

### Overview
Building a comprehensive observability system using Python decorators to monitor all function calls, capturing inputs/outputs in SQLite, and displaying via Dash UI.

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Foundation First**: Get core decorator + queue + storage perfect before UI
2. **Smart Serialization**: Handle all data types gracefully with size limits
3. **Performance Target**: <50µs decorator overhead (realistic)
4. **Retention**: 6-hour hot storage in SQLite, Phase 3 cold storage to S3
