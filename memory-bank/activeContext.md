# Active Context

## Current Status: Trade Watcher Daily Positions Fix Implemented ✓

### What Just Happened (2025-01-27)
- **Fixed Trade Watcher**: Added missing `update_daily_position()` calls to trade_ledger_watcher.py
- **Continuous Updates**: Daily positions table now updates in real-time as trades are processed
- **Native Integration**: Using the existing pnl_fifo_lifo module's update mechanism
- **Production Safe**: Changes made carefully to avoid disrupting production trades.db

### Changes Made
1. **Import Added**: `update_daily_position` imported from `.data_manager`
2. **Update Logic Added**: After each trade is processed through FIFO/LIFO:
   - Calculate realized quantities and P&L deltas
   - Get trading day from trade timestamp
   - Call `update_daily_position()` to update the table
3. **Pattern Matched**: Followed the same pattern used in `main.py` batch processing

### Daily Positions Table Now Updates
- **open_position**: Continuously recalculated net position
- **closed_position**: Incremented with each realized trade
- **realized_pnl**: Incremented with P&L from offsetting trades
- **unrealized_pnl**: Still only updates at 2pm/4pm (by design)

### Production Considerations
- No tests run against production trades.db
- Changes are minimal and surgical
- Existing functionality preserved
- Database connection handling unchanged

## Previous Status: PnL System Clean Slate Achieved ✓

### What Happened Earlier (Phase 3 - Completed 2025-07-25)
- **Complete PnL System Removal**: All existing PnL code has been removed
- **Clean Slate Approach**: Pre-production system allowed aggressive removal
- **~200 Files Removed**: Dashboards, scripts, tests, services, engines
- **Database Cleanup**: All PnL tables dropped, pnl_tracker.db removed
- **File Watchers Preserved**: Converted to minimal skeletons for integration

### Rollback Safety
- **Git Tag**: `pre-pnl-removal-20250725-141713`
- **Database Backups**: `backups/pre-removal-20250725/`
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every removal documented

### Integration Ready
The codebase is now ready for clean integration of a new PnL module:
- **Trade Watcher**: `lib/trading/pnl_calculator/trade_preprocessor.py`
- **Pipeline Watcher**: `lib/trading/pnl_integration/pnl_pipeline_watcher.py`
- **Integration Spec**: `memory-bank/pnl_migration/integration_specification.md`

### Next Steps
1. New PnL module can be integrated cleanly
2. No legacy code conflicts
3. Clear integration points documented
4. Simple callback-based architecture

## Previous Context (Now Resolved)
The previous confusion about multiple PnL systems has been completely eliminated through the Phase 3 clean slate removal.
