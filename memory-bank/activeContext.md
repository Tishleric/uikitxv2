# Active Context

## Current Task
Successfully completed implementation of factory/facade pattern for bond_future_options module per CTO request.

## Summary of Completed Work

### 1. API Alignment (Completed)
- Updated api.py to match app.py implementation exactly
- Changed tolerance from 1e-9 to 1e-6
- Added MAX_IMPLIED_VOL=1000, MIN_PRICE_SAFEGUARD=1/64
- Implemented moneyness-based initial guess (20 for ATM, 50 for OTM)
- Added safeguards: arbitrage checks, zero derivative handling, bounds checking
- Added @monitor decorators throughout
- Created test_api_alignment.py - all tests passing

### 2. Factory/Facade Architecture (Completed)
Created a clean separation between API interface and model implementation:
- `option_model_interface.py`: Protocol defining standard interface for all option models
- `models/bachelier_v1.py`: Wrapper for existing implementation
- `model_factory.py`: Registry and creation of models
- `greek_calculator_api.py`: High-level facade with simple analyze() method

Architecture flow:
```
Client → GreekCalculatorAPI → ModelFactory → BachelierV1 → Existing API
```

### 3. Spot Risk Integration (Completed)
- Modified calculator.py to use GreekCalculatorAPI instead of direct imports
- Automatic future price extraction from DataFrame (checks multiple column name cases)
- Batch processing of all options through the API
- Added all Greek columns: delta_F, delta_y, gamma_y, vega_y, theta_F, volga_price, vanna_F_price, charm_F, speed_F, color_F, ultima, zomma
- Added status columns: implied_vol, greek_calc_success, greek_calc_error, model_version
- Maintains backward compatibility with calculate_single_greek method
- Improved error handling: raises ValueError when no future price found (fail-fast principle)

### 4. Full Pipeline Testing (Completed)
- Fixed column name mismatch issue ('instrument_key' → 'key')
- Successfully processes actual CSV file (bav_analysis_20250708_104022.csv)
- Handles lowercase column names from parser
- 48/50 successful Greek calculations (2 expected failures due to minimum price safeguard)
- Output saved to data/output/spot_risk/bav_analysis_processed.csv

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Easy model comparison**: New models can be added by implementing OptionModelInterface and registering with factory
2. **No breaking changes**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
3. **Clean separation**: Model implementation details hidden behind facade
4. **Future extensibility**: Can easily add model versioning, A/B testing, performance metrics
5. **Maintainability**: Changes to model internals don't affect API consumers
6. **Robust error handling**: Clear error messages and fail-fast behavior

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance in production
- Consider adding model comparison utilities
- Document new model addition process for future developers
