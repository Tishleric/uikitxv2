# Active Context

## Current Status: PnL System Clean Slate Achieved âœ“

### What Just Happened (Phase 3 - Completed 2025-07-25)
- **Complete PnL System Removal**: All existing PnL code has been removed
- **Clean Slate Approach**: Pre-production system allowed aggressive removal
- **~200 Files Removed**: Dashboards, scripts, tests, services, engines
- **Database Cleanup**: All PnL tables dropped, pnl_tracker.db removed
- **File Watchers Preserved**: Converted to minimal skeletons for integration

### Current State
- **No PnL Logic**: All calculation code removed
- **Clean Integration Points**: Two skeleton file watchers ready
- **No Database Conflicts**: Fresh start for new schema
- **Full Documentation**: Complete removal manifest and integration spec

### Rollback Safety
- **Git Tag**: `pre-pnl-removal-20250725-141713`
- **Database Backups**: `backups/pre-removal-20250725/`
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every removal documented

### Integration Ready
The codebase is now ready for clean integration of a new PnL module:
- **Trade Watcher**: `lib/trading/pnl_calculator/trade_preprocessor.py`
- **Pipeline Watcher**: `lib/trading/pnl_integration/pnl_pipeline_watcher.py`
- **Integration Spec**: `memory-bank/pnl_migration/integration_specification.md`

### Next Steps
1. New PnL module can be integrated cleanly
2. No legacy code conflicts
3. Clear integration points documented
4. Simple callback-based architecture

## Previous Context (Now Resolved)
The previous confusion about multiple PnL systems has been completely eliminated through the Phase 3 clean slate removal.
