# Active Context

## Current Focus
- ✅ Spot Risk Dashboard implementation completed (all 9 phases + bug fixes)
- Next: Testing with various CSV files and performance optimization
- Future: Implement graph view for Spot Risk dashboard

## Recent Completions
- ✅ Bond future options API factory pattern implementation
- ✅ Spot Risk Dashboard complete implementation
  - UI structure with filters and Greek selection (Phases 1-6)
  - Data integration with Greek processing (Phase 7)
  - Complete callback system with filters and export (Phase 8)
  - Auto-refresh functionality (Phase 9)
  - Fixed strike filter TypeError for futures with 'INVALID' strikes
  - Fixed strike range display None formatting error
  - Fixed RangeSlider "NaNundefined" initialization issue

## Technical Context
- Dashboard integrated with main navigation at "Spot Risk" entry
- Reuses SpotRiskGreekCalculator from bond_future_options API
- CSV data loaded from data/input/actant_spot_risk/
- Full MVC pattern with controller, views, and callbacks modules
- All callbacks decorated with @monitor for observability
- Strike range dynamically updates based on loaded data

## Known Issues
- Graph view is placeholder only - needs implementation
- Export currently only logs - needs actual CSV download
- Performance with large datasets needs testing

## Next Steps
1. Test dashboard with various CSV files and edge cases
2. Implement graph view functionality (Greek profiles)
3. Add real CSV export with download
4. Performance optimization if needed
5. User acceptance testing
