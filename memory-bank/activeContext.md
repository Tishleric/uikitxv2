## Current Task: Bond Future Options API Alignment & Spot Risk Integration

### Completed (2025-01-13)

#### Phase 1: API Alignment âœ“
- **1.1 Parameter Alignment**: Updated `api.py` to match `app.py` exactly
  - Changed default tolerance from 1e-9 to 1e-6
  - Added MAX_IMPLIED_VOL (1000) and MIN_PRICE_SAFEGUARD (1/64) constants
  - Implemented moneyness-based initial guess logic (20 for ATM, 50 for OTM)
  - Added @monitor decorator to all API functions
  
- **1.2 Safeguard Implementation**: Added all safety checks
  - Arbitrage violation check (market_price >= 0.95 * intrinsic_value)
  - Zero derivative handling with escape attempts
  - Volatility bounds checking (0.1 to 1000)
  - Minimum price safeguard for deep OTM options
  - Convergence failure error messages with details
  
- **1.3 Testing & Verification**: Created comprehensive test suite
  - `test_api_alignment.py` verifies identical results between API and analysis functions
  - All tests passing: volatilities match within 1e-6 tolerance
  - Greeks match exactly (delta, gamma, vega, theta, etc.)
  - Edge cases handled correctly (arbitrage, min price, convergence)
  - Batch processing working with proper error handling

### Next Steps

#### Phase 2: Factory/Facade Architecture
- Create `option_model_interface.py` with OptionModelInterface protocol
- Implement BachelierV1 class wrapping current implementation
- Create ModelFactory for model instantiation
- Build GreekCalculatorAPI facade

#### Phase 3: Spot Risk Integration
- Update spot_risk calculator to use new API
- Add Greeks calculation to CSV processing
- Test with `bav_analysis_20250708_104022.csv`

### Key Decisions Made
- API now uses exact same parameters as app.py implementation
- All safeguards from memory ID 2633336 are incorporated
- @monitor decorator applied throughout for observatory visibility
- Error messages include full details including "failed to converge" status

### Technical Notes
- Solver improvements: handles zero derivatives by perturbing volatility
- Better convergence: dampens large jumps for stability
- All API functions return consistent error structure with `error_message` field
