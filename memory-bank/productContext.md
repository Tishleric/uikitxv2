# Product Context

## Project Purpose
UIKitXv2 aims to provide a robust, consistent UI component library with integrated performance tracing and logging capabilities. It serves as both a UI toolkit and a performance monitoring system for Python applications.

## Target Audience
- Python developers building data-centric web applications
- Teams that need both UI components and performance tracing
- Projects requiring detailed execution logs for analysis or debugging

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Simplified UI Development
- Consistent component API abstracts Dash/Plotly complexity
- Type-safe interfaces reduce errors
- Standardized styling and theming

### 2. Performance Visibility
- Function execution timing with @TraceTime
- Memory usage tracking with @TraceMemory
- CPU utilization monitoring with @TraceCpu
- Resource lifecycle management with @TraceCloser

### 3. Persistent Logging
- SQLite-based logging for later analysis
- Structured log format for easy querying
- Console logging for real-time monitoring

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- Minimal boilerplate when creating UIs
- Clear documentation and examples
- Type safety throughout
- Predictable performance

### For Application Users
- Consistent UI appearance and behavior
- Responsive interfaces
- Reliable data presentation

## Key Use Cases

1. **Data Analysis Dashboards**
   - Displaying interactive charts and graphs
   - Showing tabular data with filtering/sorting
   - Form-based data input

2. **Application Performance Monitoring**
   - Tracking function execution times
   - Identifying memory leaks
   - Monitoring CPU usage hotspots

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Building UI for ETL processes
   - Visualizing process flows
   - Monitoring execution status
