# TYU5 Migration Phases 1-3: Comprehensive Test Report

## Executive Summary

The TYU5 migration phases 1-3 have been tested comprehensively. The system is **functionally complete** with some data consistency issues that need attention before proceeding to Phase 4.

### Overall Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL WITH CAVEATS

---

## Phase 1: Schema Enhancement ✅ FULLY SUCCESSFUL

### Tables Created (6/6)
All required tables were successfully created with correct schema:

| Table | Status | Key Features |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `lot_positions` | ✅ Complete | Individual lot tracking with FIFO |
| `position_greeks` | ✅ Complete | Delta, gamma, vega, theta, speed storage |
| `risk_scenarios` | ✅ Complete | Price scenario analysis |
| `match_history` | ✅ Complete | FIFO match audit trail |
| `pnl_attribution` | ✅ Complete | P&L decomposition by Greeks |
| `schema_migrations` | ✅ Complete | Version tracking |

### Database Enhancements
- ✅ `short_quantity` column added to positions table
- ✅ 14 indexes created for query optimization
- ✅ WAL mode enabled for better concurrency
- ✅ All foreign key relationships established

**Assessment:** Schema is production-ready with all planned features implemented.

## Phase 2: Database Writer ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

### Data Persistence Results

| Data Type | Records | Status | Notes |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| Lot Positions | 6 | ✅ Working | 3 symbols with individual lots |
| Risk Scenarios | 104 | ✅ Working | 5 symbols with scenarios |
| Position Greeks | 0 | ❌ Missing | No Greeks data persisted |
| Match History | 0 | ⚠️ Empty | No FIFO matches recorded yet |

### Key Findings:
1. **32nds Price Conversion**: ✅ Successfully converting prices (e.g., 110.625)
2. **Lot Tracking**: ✅ Working for 3 symbols (TYU5, 3MN5P options)
3. **Risk Scenarios**: ✅ 13-39 scenarios per symbol
4. **Greeks Missing**: ❌ No option Greeks being calculated/stored

**Assessment:** Core functionality works but Greeks calculation needs investigation.

---

## Phase 3: Unified Service ✅ MOSTLY SUCCESSFUL

### API Functionality

| Feature | Status | Performance |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `get_positions_with_lots()` | ✅ Working | 9.86ms for 8 positions |
| `get_portfolio_greeks()` | ⚠️ Returns zeros | 4.68ms (no data) |
| `get_risk_scenarios()` | ✅ Working | 4.77ms for 104 scenarios |
| `get_portfolio_summary()` | ✅ Working | 12.19ms |

### Service Integration
- ✅ TYU5 features enabled and detected
- ✅ Graceful fallback working
- ✅ Both UnifiedPnLAPI and UnifiedPnLService operational
- ✅ Query performance excellent (all under 13ms)

**Assessment:** API layer is robust and performant.

## Data Integrity Issues ⚠️

### 1. Position/Lot Mismatch
**5 positions don't have corresponding lot data:**
- TYWN25P4 109.750 Comdty (200 position, no lots)
- TYWN25P4 110.500 Comdty (2 position, no lots)
- VBYN25P3 109.500 Comdty (400 position, no lots)
- VBYN25P3 110.000 Comdty (200 position, no lots)
- VBYN25P3 110.250 Comdty (300 position, no lots)

**Root Cause:** TYU5 writer only processes symbols it receives in Excel output. These positions exist in TradePreprocessor but weren't in the TYU5 calculation run.

### 2. Inconsistent Scenario Counts
- Standard symbols: 13 scenarios each
- VY3N5: 39 scenarios (3x normal)
- WY4N5: 26 scenarios (2x normal)

**Root Cause:** Multiple calculation runs or different scenario parameters.

### 3. Missing Greeks
No option Greeks are being calculated despite having option positions.

**Root Cause:** Likely missing volatility data (vtexp) or option parameters.

---

## Performance Metrics ✅ EXCELLENT

### Query Performance
- Position queries: **9.86ms** 
- Greek queries: **4.68ms**
- Scenario queries: **4.77ms**
- Summary queries: **12.19ms**

### Storage Efficiency
- Database size: **0.18 MB** (very efficient)
- 6 lot positions + 104 scenarios = minimal footprint

**Assessment:** Performance is production-ready.

---

## Recommendations Before Phase 4

### Critical Issues to Address:

1. **Fix Position/Lot Consistency**
   - Ensure all positions get processed through TYU5
   - Add validation to catch mismatches
   - Consider batch reconciliation process

2. **Enable Greek Calculations**
   - Verify vtexp data is available
   - Check option pricing parameters
   - Test with known option positions

3. **Standardize Scenario Counts**
   - Ensure consistent scenario generation
   - Document expected scenario parameters
   - Add validation for scenario consistency

### Nice-to-Have Improvements:

1. **Add Match History**
   - Process some closing trades to populate FIFO matches
   - Verify match tracking works correctly

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Add alerts for data consistency issues
   - Create reconciliation reports
   - Monitor Greek calculation failures

## Conclusion

**Phases 1-3 are functionally complete** and the architecture is solid. The unified service successfully integrates both P&L systems and provides efficient access to advanced features.

**Before proceeding to Phase 4 (UI Integration):**
1. Resolve the position/lot consistency issue
2. Fix Greek calculations for options
3. Add data validation checks

**The system is ready for controlled testing** but needs these issues addressed before full production deployment.
