# RosettaStone Translator Migration Log

This document tracks all replacements of legacy translators with RosettaStone.

## Migration Summary

### Total Replacements: 13 files

- **Production Code**: 3 files
  - lib/trading/actant/spot_risk/database.py
  - lib/trading/actant/spot_risk/parser.py
  - lib/trading/market_prices/spot_risk_symbol_adapter.py

- **Scripts**: 10 files
  - 6 utility scripts
  - 4 test scripts
  
### Key Findings

1. **Format Mismatches**: Several scripts were using the wrong translator:
   - SymbolTranslator expects ActantTrades format but was being fed ActantRisk format
   - This has been corrected with RosettaStone by specifying the correct source format

2. **Simplification**: The spot_risk_symbol_adapter.py was significantly simplified:
   - Removed complex conversion logic since RosettaStone handles ActantRisk directly
   - Removed fallback to SpotRiskSymbolTranslator

3. **Unified Interface**: All translations now use the same method signature:
   ```python
   rosetta.translate(symbol, source_format, target_format)
   ```

### Next Steps

1. **Phase 6**: Remove deprecated translators:
   - lib/trading/symbol_translator.py
   - lib/trading/actant/spot_risk/spot_risk_symbol_translator.py
   - data/reference/symbol_translation/mapping.py (if TreasuryOptionsTranslator is unused)

2. **Verification**: Run scripts/verify_rosetta_migration.py to ensure everything works

3. **Testing**: Run existing test suites to ensure no regressions
