# Python Environment Fix Summary

## What We Found
1. **Anaconda3** is installed at: `C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3`
2. **Direct Python 3.13** is installed at: `C:\Users\erict\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313`
3. Neither were in your PATH, causing the conflict

## What We Fixed
✅ **Permanently added Anaconda to your PATH** with these directories:
   - `C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3`
   - `C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3\Scripts`
   - `C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3\Library\bin`

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Remove Direct Python Installation
**Option A: Through Windows Settings (Recommended)**
   - Press `Win + I` to open Settings
   - Go to **Apps > Apps & features**
   - Search for "Python 3.13"
   - Click on it and select **Uninstall**

**Option B: Manual Removal**
   - Delete the folder: `C:\Users\erict\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313`
   - You may need Administrator privileges

### 2. Disable Windows Store Python Aliases
   - Open Windows Settings (`Win + I`)
   - Go to **Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases**
   - Turn **OFF** both:
     - `python.exe`
     - `python3.exe`

### 3. Restart Your Terminal
   - **Close all PowerShell/Terminal windows**
   - Open a new PowerShell window

### 4. Initialize Conda for PowerShell
Run this command in your new terminal:
```powershell
conda init powershell
```

### 5. Verify Everything Works
After restarting, test these commands:
```powershell
python --version     # Should show Python 3.13.5 from Anaconda
pip --version        # Should show pip from Anaconda
conda --version      # Should show conda 25.5.1
where python         # Should show C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3\python.exe
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Python Still Doesn't Work After Restart:
1. Check if PATH was saved correctly:
   ```powershell
   [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")
   ```
   Look for Anaconda paths at the beginning

2. Manually run the PATH fix script again:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\fix_anaconda_path.ps1
   ```

3. If conda commands don't work, reinitialize:
   ```powershell
   C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3\Scripts\conda.exe init powershell
   ```

### For VS Code/Cursor:
1. Open VS Code/Cursor
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
4. Choose the Anaconda Python: `C:\Users\erict\Anaconda3\python.exe`

## Clean Up
Once everything is working, you can delete these helper scripts:
- `fix_anaconda_path.ps1`
- `remove_direct_python.ps1`
- This summary file

## Important Notes
- Your Anaconda installation appears to have Python 3.13.5 (unusual for Anaconda, but it works)
- All your previously installed packages in Anaconda should still work
- If you had packages installed in the direct Python, you'll need to reinstall them using:
  ```powershell
  pip install <package-name>
  # or
  conda install <package-name>
  ```

## Success Indicators
You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ `python` command works from any directory
- ✅ `pip` installs packages to Anaconda
- ✅ `conda` commands work properly
- ✅ No "Python not found" errors
- ✅ VS Code/Cursor uses Anaconda Python
