# Future Work: Achieving 10/10 Robustness

**Created**: June 17, 2025  
**Purpose**: Document remaining simple tasks to achieve perfect robustness score  
**Time Estimate**: 1 day total

## Current Status: 8/10 → 10/10

We've achieved 8/10 robustness through systematic improvements. The remaining 2 points can be gained through simple, practical solutions.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Memory Pressure Tests (2 hours)

**Goal**: Verify system behavior under memory constraints

**Implementation**:
```python
# tests/monitoring/observability/test_memory_pressure.py
- Test with resource.setrlimit() to limit memory
- Verify graceful handling of MemoryError
- Test serializer with huge objects (10M+ items)
- Confirm lazy serialization prevents OOM
```

**Key Tests**:
- Monitor under 100MB memory limit
- Serializer with 80MB+ objects
- Queue behavior when system is swapping
- Graceful degradation under pressure

### 2. Basic Circuit Breaker (3 hours)

**Goal**: Prevent cascading SQLite failures

**Implementation**:
```python
# lib/monitoring/circuit_breaker.py
- Simple 50-line circuit breaker class
- Failure threshold (default: 5)
- Timeout period (default: 60s)
- Automatic recovery attempts
```

**Integration Points**:
- SQLite writer: `self.circuit_breaker.call(self._execute_batch, batch)`
- Configurable thresholds
- Metrics for circuit state
- Clean error propagation

### 3. Performance Guide (1 hour)

**Goal**: Clear documentation on performance limits and solutions

**Content**:
```markdown
# docs/performance-guide.md

## Sampling Guidelines
- Hot loops (>1000/sec): 1% sampling
- Regular (10-1000/sec): 10% sampling
- Critical (<10/sec): 100% sampling

## Known Limits
- SQLite: ~1,089 ops/sec
- Queue: 10k + 50k overflow
- Overhead: <50µs per call

## Alternatives for High Throughput
- Use sampling
- Consider ClickHouse/TimescaleDB
- Separate observability infrastructure
```

### 4. Unsupported Patterns Doc (1 hour)

**Goal**: Document what we don't support with workarounds

**Content**:
```markdown
# docs/unsupported-patterns.md

## Not Supported (By Design)
1. Metaclass methods - Log manually
2. Slots with descriptors - Monitor callers
3. Infinite coroutines - Use sampling
4. Dynamic function creation - Wrap manually

## Supported Patterns
✅ Regular/async functions
✅ Generators (sync/async)
✅ Class/static methods
✅ Exception handling
✅ Multi-threading/processing
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with tests** - Memory pressure tests reveal actual behavior
2. **Keep it simple** - Circuit breaker is just 50 lines
3. **Document honestly** - Clear about what we support
4. **Provide workarounds** - Help users handle edge cases

## Success Metrics

- Zero data loss under memory pressure
- Graceful degradation with circuit breaker
- Clear performance boundaries documented
- All limitations explicitly stated

## Why This Gets Us to 10/10

These tasks address the final 20% of robustness:
- **Memory handling**: Tested and documented
- **Error recovery**: Circuit breaker prevents cascades
- **Performance clarity**: Users know the limits
- **Edge case honesty**: We document what we don't do

The key insight: 10/10 doesn't mean handling everything - it means handling what we claim perfectly and being honest about limitations.
