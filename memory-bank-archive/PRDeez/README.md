# PRDeez - Product Requirement Documents

This directory contains product requirement documents and implementation plans for UIKitXv2 features.

## Current Documents

### Observability System
- **`logsystem.md`** - Original design brief for the observability system (v0.2)
  - Describes the vision for real-time function monitoring
  - Contains mockup screenshots and initial technical approach
  - Status: Superseded by implementation plan

- **`observability-implementation-plan.md`** - Refined implementation plan (v1.0)
  - Incorporates feedback from technical review
  - Contains concrete API specifications
  - Phased approach with clear deliverables
  - Status: **ACTIVE** - This is the current plan being implemented

## Document Workflow

1. Initial briefs are created based on product requirements
2. Technical review identifies gaps and refinements needed
3. Implementation plans are created with concrete specifications
4. Plans are updated as implementation progresses

## Quick Links

For current observability work:
- Implementation checklist: See Phase 0 in `observability-implementation-plan.md`
- Active tasks: Check `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- Progress tracking: See `memory-bank/progress.md`

# PRDeez Directory

This directory is intended to contain:

- Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)
- User stories
- Acceptance tests
- Feature specifications

Currently, the project is using the memory-bank files for high-level documentation and requirements, with detailed implementation handled in code comments and test suites.

As the project expands, formal PRDs and user stories will be added to this directory.
