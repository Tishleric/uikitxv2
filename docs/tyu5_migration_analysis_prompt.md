# TYU5 P&L System Migration Analysis and Integration Prompt

## Objective
You are tasked with analyzing the existing P&L tracking systems and developing a migration strategy to integrate the sophisticated tyu5_pnl system with the current SQLite-based position tracking infrastructure. This requires careful analysis to preserve advanced functionality while ensuring compatibility with existing systems.

## Context and Background

### Current State: Two Parallel P&L Systems

1. **TradePreprocessor Pipeline** (`lib/trading/pnl_calculator/`)
   - Simple FIFO position tracking
   - Feeds into SQLite database (`data/output/pnl/pnl_tracker.db`)
   - Tables: `positions`, `cto_trades`, `processed_trades`
   - Used by FULLPNL table building process
   - Limited functionality (no Greeks, no attribution)

2. **TYU5 P&L System** (`lib/trading/pnl/tyu5_pnl/`)
   - Sophisticated position tracking with short support
   - Bachelier model for option pricing
   - P&L attribution (delta, gamma, vega, theta components)
   - Risk matrix generation
   - Excel output only (no database integration)
   - Rich position breakdown and analysis

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **Symbol Format Differences**
   - TradePreprocessor: Bloomberg format (e.g., "TYU5 Comdty", "VBYN25P3 110.250 Comdty")
   - TYU5: Mixed formats in sample data
   - Need consistent translation strategy

2. **Data Model Differences**
   - TradePreprocessor: Simple position quantity and average cost
   - TYU5: Detailed lot tracking with attribution
   - Database schema may need enhancement

3. **Calculation Methodology**
   - TradePreprocessor: Basic FIFO only
   - TYU5: FIFO with full Greek calculations and Bachelier pricing
   - Need to preserve advanced calculations

## Analysis Requirements

### Phase 1: Deep System Analysis

1. **Analyze TYU5 P&L System Components**
   ```
   lib/trading/pnl/tyu5_pnl/
   ├── core/
   │   ├── bachelier.py          # Bachelier model implementation
   │   ├── position_calculator.py # Position tracking logic
   │   ├── trade_processor.py    # Trade processing with FIFO
   │   ├── risk_matrix.py        # Risk scenario analysis
   │   └── pnl_summary.py        # Summary generation
   ├── main.py                   # Orchestration logic
   └── pnl_io/excel_writer.py    # Output formatting
   ```

   For each component, document:
   - Core functionality and algorithms
   - Data structures and flow
   - Dependencies and assumptions
   - Unique features to preserve

2. **Analyze Current TradePreprocessor Pipeline**
   ```
   lib/trading/pnl_calculator/
   ├── trade_preprocessor.py     # Symbol translation, trade processing
   ├── position_manager.py       # FIFO position tracking
   ├── storage.py               # SQLite persistence
   └── file_watcher.py          # File monitoring
   ```

   Document:
   - Integration points with database
   - Symbol translation logic
   - Position tracking methodology
   - Transaction handling

3. **Compare Data Models**
   - Map TYU5 data structures to current database schema
   - Identify gaps in current schema
   - Document required schema enhancements
   - Consider backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Migration Strategy Development

1. **Integration Architecture Options**

   **Option A: Replace TradePreprocessor Entirely**
   - Pros: Single source of truth, full feature set
   - Cons: Risk to existing systems, larger change
   - Implementation approach

   **Option B: Parallel Integration**
   - Run both systems, gradually migrate
   - Pros: Lower risk, validation period
   - Cons: Complexity, potential inconsistencies
   - Synchronization strategy

   **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
   - Use TYU5 for calculations, TradePreprocessor for I/O
   - Pros: Leverage strengths of both
   - Cons: Integration complexity
   - Component boundaries

2. **Database Schema Evolution**
   ```sql
   -- Analyze required changes to positions table
   -- Consider new tables for:
   --   - Lot-level tracking
   --   - Greek history
   --   - Attribution data
   --   - Risk scenarios
   ```

3. **Symbol Translation Strategy**
   - Unify symbol formats across systems
   - Enhance SymbolTranslator class
   - Handle edge cases and options

### Phase 3: Implementation Plan

1. **Detailed Technical Design**
   - Class diagrams showing integration
   - Sequence diagrams for key flows
   - Database schema modifications
   - API contracts between components

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - What could break?
   - How to validate correctness?
   - Rollback strategy
   - Performance implications

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for new components
   - Integration tests for pipelines
   - Reconciliation tests between old/new
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Migration Execution Plan**
   - Step-by-step implementation order
   - Validation checkpoints
   - Parallel run period
   - Cutover criteria

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Functional Preservation**
   - Which TYU5 features are critical to preserve?
   - What TradePreprocessor functionality must remain?
   - How to handle feature gaps?

2. **Data Consistency**
   - How to ensure position calculations match between systems?
   - What reconciliation processes are needed?
   - How to handle historical data?

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Will Greek calculations impact real-time processing?
   - Database performance with enhanced schema?
   - Optimization opportunities?

4. **Operational Impact**
   - Changes to downstream systems (FULLPNL, dashboards)?
   - User training requirements?
   - Monitoring and alerting updates?
