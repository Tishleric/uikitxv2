# FULLPNL Issues Resolved

## Summary
Investigation of FULLPNL table issues revealed several problems that have been fixed:

### 1. TYU5 Missing Price Data
**Issue**: TYU5 futures showed None for px_last and px_settle despite data existing in market_prices.db

**Root Causes**:
1. Column name mismatch: Code expected `current_price` but database had `Flash_Close`
2. Symbol classification bug: 'TYU5 Comdty' was incorrectly classified as an option because the check for 'C' (call) matched 'Comdty'
3. Null handling: Latest Flash_Close was None, needed to look back for non-null values

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated queries to use `Flash_Close as current_price`
- Changed symbol classification to check for strike price pattern instead of 'C'/'P' letters
- Modified price loading to find first non-null Flash_Close

**Result**: TYU5 now shows px_last=110.165, px_settle=110.165

### 2. TYU5 Missing Bid/Ask from Spot Risk
**Issue**: TYU5 bid/ask were None despite spot risk having data for XCME.ZN.SEP25

**Root Cause**: Symbol mismatch - TYU5 needs to map to SEP25 for spot risk lookup

**Fix Applied**: Added mapping logic: `if future_symbol == 'TYU5': search_pattern = 'SEP25'`

**Result**: TYU5 now shows bid=110.546875, ask=110.5625

### 3. Futures Gamma Issue
**Issue**: Question about gamma_f = 0.004202 for futures (should be 0)

**Finding**: No hardcoded 0.004202 found. Code was correctly setting gamma_f = 0 for futures

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced futures Greek handling to explicitly set all Greeks:
- delta_f = 63.0
- gamma_f = 0, gamma_y = 0
- vega_f = 0, vega_y = 0
- speed_f = 0, theta_f = 0

**Result**: TYU5 shows gamma_f = 0.0 as expected

### 4. Missing Y-space Greeks for Options
**Issue**: Concern that Y-space Greeks were missing

**Finding**: Y-space Greeks ARE populated for options!
- delta_y, gamma_y, vega_y all have values
- Example: 3MN5P 110.000 shows delta_y = -30.88, gamma_y = 2.21, vega_y = 28.32

**Note**: Schema only includes delta_y, gamma_y, vega_y. Missing theta_y and speed_y columns.

## Current FULLPNL Status

### Working Correctly:
- ✅ Positions (open/closed) - 100% coverage
- ✅ Bid/Ask from spot risk - 75% coverage (missing strikes not in spot risk)
- ✅ Price calculation (adjtheor → midpoint → (bid+ask)/2)
- ✅ Market prices (px_last, px_settle) 
- ✅ F-space Greeks for options
- ✅ Y-space Greeks for options (delta, gamma, vega)
- ✅ Futures Greeks (delta=63, others=0)
- ✅ vtexp values

### Known Gaps:
1. P&L columns not yet added (total_realized_pnl, total_unrealized_pnl, last_market_price)
2. theta_y and speed_y columns not in schema
3. Some strikes (109.5, 109.75) missing Greeks due to spot risk minimum strike = 110.0

## Code Changes Made

1. `lib/trading/fullpnl/data_sources.py`:
   - Fixed Flash_Close column mapping
   - Fixed symbol classification logic
   - Added TYU5 → SEP25 mapping
   - Improved null price handling

2. `lib/trading/fullpnl/builder.py`:
   - Enhanced futures Greek setting (all Greeks = 0 except delta_f = 63)

These fixes ensure FULLPNL correctly loads all available data from the source databases.
