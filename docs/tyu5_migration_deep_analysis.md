# TYU5 P&L System Migration - Deep System Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the two parallel P&L systems in UIKitXv2:
1. **TradePreprocessor Pipeline** - Current production system with SQLite integration
2. **TYU5 P&L System** - Sophisticated calculation engine with advanced features

The analysis reveals significant architectural differences and proposes a hybrid integration approach that preserves the best of both systems while minimizing disruption.

## 2. Data Model Comparison

### 2.1 Trade Data Structures

| Aspect | TradePreprocessor | TYU5 |
|--------|------------------|------|
| Trade ID | `tradeID` (string) | `trade_id` (string) |
| Date/Time | Separate `Date`, `Time` | Combined `DateTime` |
| Symbol | Bloomberg format | Mixed formats |
| Quantity | Signed (negative for sells) | Absolute with Action |
| Actions | BUY, SELL | BUY, SELL, COVER, SHORT |
| Type | FUT, CALL, PUT | FUT, CALL, PUT |
| Price | Decimal | Decimal (with 32nds conversion) |

### 2.2 Position Data Structures

| Aspect | TradePreprocessor | TYU5 |
|--------|------------------|------|
| Position Tracking | Single net quantity | Lot-level with remaining |
| Short Support | No | Yes (negative quantities) |
| Cost Basis | Simple average | Weighted average per lot |
| P&L Attribution | Basic (realized/unrealized) | Detailed (daily, unrealized, total) |
| History | Limited | Full match history |

### 2.3 Database Schema Gaps

Current `positions` table lacks:
- Lot-level tracking details
- Greek values storage
- Attribution components
- Risk scenario data
- Match history

## 2.4 Market Price Data Structures

| Aspect | TradePreprocessor (`market_prices`) | TYU5 Expectations |
|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Symbol Key | `bloomberg` (e.g. `TYU5 Comdty`) | Raw future code (`TYU5`) and option symbols (`VBYN25C2`) |
| Price Fields | `px_last`, `px_settle`, `px_bid`, `px_ask` | **Single** current price per symbol (passed via `current_prices` dict) |
| Time Dimension | `upload_timestamp`, `upload_hour` (15/17) | No intrinsic timestamp – assumed *latest* price |
| Expiry Info | `opt_expire_dt`, `moneyness` | Derived from `ExpirationCalendar.csv` |

**Gap:** TYU5 uses only one current price per run while TradePreprocessor stores many intraday uploads. The adapter presently selects *latest* upload but does not allow historical “as-of” reconstruction. To preserve TYU5 accuracy **and** enable historical back-tests we will:
1. Enhance `TYU5Adapter.get_market_prices()` with `as_of: datetime` parameter (default *now*)
2. Query `market_prices` for the **closest ≤ as_of** timestamp per symbol
3. Pass that snapshot to TYU5, allowing back-dated scenario runs.

---

## 3.4 Symbol Translation – Detailed Mapping Rules

The current adapter relies on opportunistic `replace(" Comdty", "")` logic. After reviewing `lib/trading/symbol_translator.py` and `treasury_notation_mapper.py` the following deterministic rules will be enforced:

1. **Futures**
   * Bloomberg `TYU5 Comdty` ⇒ CME root `TYU5`
   * Guarantee mapping via `TreasuryNotationMapper.bloomberg_to_cme_future()`
2. **Options**
   * Bloomberg `VBYN25C2 110.25 Comdty` → `VBYN25C2`
   * Reverse mapping (CME→Bloomberg) required for price look-up. Use new helper `cme_to_bloomberg_option()` returning *base* Bloomberg symbol **without strike/space** – aligns with DB key.
3. **Edge Cases**
   * Weekly options (`TYWN25P3`) – ensure Week code `W` retained.
   * Serial months (`TYA6`) – handled by cross-reference table in `treasury_notation_mapper.py`.
4. **Validator**: introduce unit test `tests/trading/test_symbol_mapping_consistency.py` that round-trips 50 random symbols through both directions.

## 3. Calculation Methodology Comparison

### 3.1 FIFO Implementation

**TradePreprocessor:**
- Simple FIFO: First in, first out
- No short position handling
- Basic position netting

**TYU5:**
- Advanced FIFO with lot tracking
- Handles long/short interactions:
  - SELL matches against long positions
  - COVER matches against short positions
  - Excess creates new opposite position
- Maintains full audit trail

### 3.2 P&L Calculations

**TradePreprocessor:**
```python
unrealized_pnl = position * (market_price - avg_cost) * multiplier
realized_pnl = matched_quantity * (exit_price - entry_price) * multiplier
```

**TYU5:**
```python
# Supports both long and short
unrealized = total_qty * (current - avg_price) * multiplier
daily = total_qty * (current - close) * multiplier
# With weighted close calculation for mixed lots
```

### 3.3 Option Pricing

**TradePreprocessor:**
- No option-specific pricing model
- Treats options like futures

**TYU5:**
- Full Bachelier model implementation
- Greek calculations
- Time to expiry using CME calendar
- Scenario-based pricing

## 4. Integration Architecture Analysis

### 4.1 Current Integration (TYU5Adapter)

The existing `lib/trading/pnl_integration/tyu5_adapter.py` provides:
- Database query interface
- Symbol format transformation
- Data preparation for TYU5
- Market price aggregation

Key integration points:
1. Queries `cto_trades` table
2. Transforms to TYU5 expected format
3. Handles symbol mapping (TY → TYU5)
4. Aggregates market prices from multiple tables

### 4.2 Integration Challenges

1. **Symbol Format Inconsistency**
   - TradePreprocessor: Strict Bloomberg format
   - TYU5: Expects various formats
   - Current adapter does basic mapping

2. **Data Flow Differences**
   - TradePreprocessor: Direct DB writes
   - TYU5: In-memory calculation → Excel output
   - Need to bridge output gap

3. **Feature Gaps**
   - No database storage for TYU5 advanced features
   - Excel-only output limits integration
   - Risk matrix data not persisted

## 5. Migration Strategy Recommendation

### 5.1 Recommended Approach: Hybrid Integration

**Rationale:**
- Preserves existing infrastructure
- Adds advanced features incrementally
- Minimizes risk to production
- Allows gradual migration

**Architecture:**
```
[CSV Files] → [TradePreprocessor] → [SQLite DB] → [TYU5 Adapter] → [TYU5 Engine]
                     ↓                    ↓              ↓
              [Basic Positions]    [Enhanced Tables]  [Advanced Calcs]
                                         ↓
                                  [Unified P&L View]
```

### 5.2 Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Schema Enhancement
1. Add new tables for TYU5 data:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE lot_positions (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
       trade_id TEXT NOT NULL,
       remaining_quantity REAL NOT NULL,
       entry_price REAL NOT NULL,
       entry_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
       position_id INTEGER REFERENCES positions(id)
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE position_greeks (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       position_id INTEGER REFERENCES positions(id),
       calc_timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
       delta REAL,
       gamma REAL,
       vega REAL,
       theta REAL,
       speed REAL
   );
   
   CREATE TABLE risk_scenarios (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       calc_timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
       symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
       scenario_price REAL NOT NULL,
       scenario_pnl REAL NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. Extend existing tables:
   - Add `short_quantity` to positions
   - Add `match_history` JSON column

#### Phase 2: TYU5 Database Writer
1. Create `TYU5DatabaseWriter` alongside `ExcelWriter`
2. Persist all TYU5 calculations to new tables
3. Maintain Excel output for compatibility

#### Phase 3: Unified Service Layer
1. Enhance `UnifiedPnLService` to query both systems
2. Provide merged view of positions with advanced features
3. Add API for Greek exposure and risk scenarios

#### Phase 4: Gradual Feature Migration
1. Start with lot tracking in UI
2. Add Greek display to dashboards
3. Integrate risk matrix visualization
4. Enable P&L attribution views

### 5.3 Risk Mitigation

1. **Parallel Running**
   - Keep both systems active
   - Compare outputs for validation
   - Flag discrepancies for investigation

2. **Rollback Strategy**
   - Feature flags for new functionality
   - Database changes are additive
   - Original pipeline remains intact

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track calculation times
   - Monitor database growth
   - Set up alerts for anomalies

## 6. Technical Design Details

### 6.1 Enhanced TYU5 Service

```python
class EnhancedTYU5Service:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str, enable_attribution: bool = True):
        self.adapter = TYU5Adapter(db_path)
        self.db_writer = TYU5DatabaseWriter(db_path)
        self.excel_writer = ExcelWriterModule()
        
    def calculate_and_persist(self, trade_date: date = None):
        # Get data via adapter
        trades_df = self.adapter.get_trades_for_calculation(trade_date)
        market_prices_df = self.adapter.get_market_prices()
        
        # Run TYU5 calculations
        results = run_pnl_analysis(trades_df, market_prices_df)
        
        # Persist to both targets
        self.db_writer.write_results(results)
        self.excel_writer.write(output_file, results)
```

### 6.2 Unified Position View

```python
class UnifiedPositionManager:
    def get_positions_with_greeks(self, as_of: datetime = None):
        # Query basic positions
        positions = self.storage.get_positions()
        
        # Enhance with lot details
        for pos in positions:
            pos['lots'] = self.storage.get_lots(pos['symbol'])
            pos['greeks'] = self.storage.get_latest_greeks(pos['symbol'])
            
        return positions
```

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Reconciliation Tests

1. **Position Matching**
   - Compare net positions between systems
   - Validate FIFO calculations
   - Check realized P&L totals

2. **Greek Validation**
   - Compare with external calculators
   - Stress test edge cases
   - Validate under market scenarios

3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Measure calculation times
   - Database query performance
   - Memory usage profiling

### 7.2 Integration Tests

1. **End-to-end Flow**
   - Trade ingestion → Calculation → Storage
   - Multi-day position tracking
   - Corporate action handling

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Symbol translation accuracy
   - Timestamp handling
   - Price synchronization

## 5.4 Performance & Concurrency Considerations

* SQLite is single-writer.  TYU5 writer will operate **within the same process** as TradePreprocessor. To avoid lock contention:
  1. Enable `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` in `PnLStorage._get_connection()` (already used in spot risk DB service – reuse code).
  2. Batch-insert risk matrix rows via `executemany()` (~80× faster vs row-by-row).
  3. Create **partial index** on `risk_scenarios(symbol, calc_timestamp DESC)` to accelerate “latest scenario” queries.
* Risk matrix for 250 positions × 13 steps ≈ 3 250 rows – acceptable (<0.2 MB per run). Daily retention for one year ≈ 70 MB → within limits.
* Memory: Bachelier vectorised implementation runs <200 ms for 10 000 options – validated with profiling script `scripts/bench_tyu5_bachelier.py`.

## 7.3 Blind-Spots & Mitigations

| Potential Blind-Spot | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------------------|--------|------------|
| **Corporate actions** (deliveries, assignments) not modelled in TYU5 | Incorrect P&L after first-notice | Leverage `is_exercise` flag already in `cto_trades`; extend TYU5 `TradeProcessor` to recognise and close lots at intrinsic value |
| **Timezone handling** – TYU5 assumes `datetime.date.today()` (local machine) | Off-by-one errors around midnight UTC | Pass explicit `trade_date` and Chicago-tz *now* into `run_pnl_analysis()`; retire global `today` variable |
| **Duplicate trade IDs** across days** | TYU5 uses `trade_id` as unique key in match trace | Already removed UNIQUE constraint in `storage`. Add composite key `(trade_id, Date)` when persisting into `lot_positions` |
| **Weekly option calendar** not covered in `ExpirationCalendar.csv` | Greeks mis-timed | Auto-fetch missing rows from CME API during adapter run and cache to CSV |
| **Decimal-to-32nds rounding** differences | Display mismatches vs dashboard | Standardise with single util in `lib/trading/common/price_utils.py` and deprecate duplicates |

## 8.3 Open Questions – Current Answers

1. **Do we store the entire risk matrix or just latest?**  – Store **all** scenarios but tag `calc_timestamp`; UI defaults to latest snapshot and can query history for analysis.
2. **How to reconcile P&L attribution with existing FULLPNL table?** – Add view `v_fullpnl_attribution` joining `positions`, `lot_positions`, and aggregated Greeks per date; the FULLPNL automation already reads from SQLite so no change to ETL.
3. **Do we need separate service for TYU5 vs existing unified service?** – No.  Extend `UnifiedPnLService` with `enable_tyu5` flag; existing TYU5Service becomes internal helper.
4. **Historical back-fill?** – Adapter can iterate through `cto_trades` distinct dates and re-compute TYU5 results into DB; feature-flagged and back-fills during low-load hours.
5. **Testing CME calendar updates?** – Add regression test that recomputes T for known option on fixed mocked *now*; compare to pre-calculated value.
