# FIFO Realized P&L Test Results

## Summary

The comprehensive test suite `test_realized_pnl_production_fidelity.py` successfully validates our FIFO realized P&L calculations using actual production trade data.

## Key Findings

### 1. Actual Production Data (2025-07-21)

Using real trades from `trades_20250721.csv`:

```
Trade 1: SELL 1 @ 111.25    → Opens short position
Trade 2: BUY 1 @ 111.21875  → Closes short for $31.25 profit
Trade 3: BUY 1 @ 111.15625  → Opens long position
Trade 4: BUY 1 @ 111.109375 → Adds to long position
```

**Verified Calculation**:
- Short P&L = (Entry 111.25 - Exit 111.21875) × 1 × 1000 = **$31.25** ✓

### 2. FIFO Matching Logic

The test confirms proper FIFO (First-In-First-Out) matching:

```
Initial: SELL 5 @ 111.25
Trade 2: BUY 3 @ 111.20  → Matches first 3 units, P&L = $150
Trade 3: BUY 4 @ 111.15  → Matches remaining 2 units, P&L = $200
                         → 2 units remain as new long position
Trade 5: SELL 2 @ 111.18 → Matches the 2 longs @ 111.15, P&L = $60
```

Total Realized P&L: $410 ✓

### 3. Calculation Precision

Tested with various decimal prices:
- Handles 6 decimal places accurately
- Correctly calculates both profits and losses
- Maintains precision for large quantities

Example:
```
Buy 100 @ 110.0, Sell 100 @ 110.00390625
P&L = (110.00390625 - 110.0) × 100 × 1000 = $390.625 ✓
```

### 4. Database State Verification

After each trade, the test verifies:
- `trades_fifo` table contains correct open positions
- `realized_fifo` table records all realizations with accurate P&L
- `daily_positions` table accumulates realized P&L correctly

## How FIFO Realized P&L Works

1. **Trade Matching**: When a new trade arrives, it searches for opposite positions ordered by sequence ID (oldest first)

2. **P&L Calculation**:
   - For closing longs: `(Exit Price - Entry Price) × Quantity × 1000`
   - For closing shorts: `(Entry Price - Exit Price) × Quantity × 1000`

3. **Partial Fills**: If the closing trade is larger than the position, it partially closes and continues to the next position

4. **Database Updates**:
   - Removes or reduces matched positions in `trades_fifo`
   - Records realizations in `realized_fifo`
   - Updates daily totals in `daily_positions`

## Test Output Example

```
--- Processing Trade 2 ---
Action: B 1.0 @ 111.21875

REALIZATION OCCURRED:
  - Matched 1.0 units
  - Entry Price: 111.25
  - Exit Price: 111.21875
  - P&L Calculation: (111.25 - 111.21875) × 1.0 × 1000
  - Realized P&L: $31.25
```

## Confidence Level

The test suite provides **high confidence** in our FIFO realized P&L calculations:
- ✓ Uses actual production data
- ✓ Shows detailed calculation steps
- ✓ Verifies database state
- ✓ Tests edge cases (partial fills, multiple positions)
- ✓ Confirms calculation precision

The realized P&L calculations in production should match these test results exactly.
