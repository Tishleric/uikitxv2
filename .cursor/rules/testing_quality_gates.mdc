# Testing & Quality Gates

• TEST_OUTSIDE_PACKAGE — All new tests go under [tests/](mdc:tests), never inside [src/](mdc:src).

• GOLDEN_TRACE_MATCH — Integration tests for decorators must compare SQLite rows against [expected_trace.json](mdc:demo/expected_trace.json).

• STRICT_STATIC_ANALYSIS — New code must pass ruff, mypy --strict, and pytest locally before Cursor marks the task complete.
